# Welcome to the DCC Guides!
These guides are an initiative from TU Delft [Digital Competence Center](/docs/community/dcc.md) and aim to provide a comprehensive entrypoint to get you started with Research Computing, Research Data and Research Software at TU Delft.

## **Disclaimer**

The guides are under active development and mainly in use as a useful resource for the support provided by the DCC. The content is a compilation of developed solutions, relevant links and resources, and documents produced by colleagues inside and outside TU Delft. This is not an official TU Delft website, but rather a place where we keep note of things we find important and useful to share.
:::

The guides are split into a few major sections:

- **Computing Infrastructure** contains information and guides on TU Delft ICT infrastructure.
- **Data Management** contains information and guides on using TU Delft data storage options and best-practices for FAIR data. 
- **Research Software** contains information for creating FAIR research software.
- **Resources** contains a collection of courses, workshops, and references.
