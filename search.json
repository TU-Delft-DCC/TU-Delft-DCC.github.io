    "text": "Collaborative workflow\nFollowing the GitHub Flow model, everything starts from the main branch. Developers can create feature branches from the main branch to isolate their work. Once ready, changes are merged back to main.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Workflow variations\n\n\n\nWhile the GitHub Flow workflow focuses on main, some opt for a hybrid approach to include a develop branch either as a staging area for pre-release testing or ongoing integration (aggregating features before merging to main). This approach borrows elements from GitFlow (e.g., a long-lived develop branch) without adopting its full branching model.\n\n\nA common workflow in a collaborative development project.\n\nCreate a feature branch: Start by creating a new branch of the main branch (or develop if used). This branch should have a descriptive name to give an idea of the work that will be done, such as a new feature or a bug fix. This separation allows you to work independently without affecting the main codebase.\nMake changes and commit: Work on your branch, making the necessary changes to the code. Commit these changes with clear, descriptive messages.\nOpen a pull request: Once you have made your changes, open a pull request (PR). PRs allow for discussion, review, and additional changes if necessary.\nReview: Before merging, your changes might go through a review process where other team members can give feedback. Some projects may require a review before merging is allowed.\nMerge: Finally, once your changes are reviewed and tested, you can merge the pull request into main (or develop, if applicable). This incorporates your contributions into the project, making them part of the official codebase.\nDelete feature branch: Feature branches should be short-lived, thus avoiding potential conflicts due to the divergence of the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence diagram of workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Author\n    participant R as Reviewer\n    A-&gt;&gt;A: Write some code in your branch or fork\n    A-&gt;&gt;R: Open a pull request\n    R-&gt;&gt;R: Add comments to a review\n    R-&gt;&gt;A: Submit a review\n    loop Until approved\n        A-&gt;&gt;R: Address or respond to review comments\n        R-&gt;&gt;A: Clarify or resolve comments\n    end\n    R-&gt;&gt;A: Approve pull request\n    A-&gt;&gt;A: Merge pull request\n    A-&gt;&gt;A: Delete branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForking\nExternal collaborators who do not have the same administrative rights to the repository can fork the project. They make their changes on their forked repository in a new feature branch. Steps 3-5 remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Create “Draft” Pull Requests!\n\n\n\nWith Draft PR’s you:\n\nwant to signal that a pull request is just the start of the conversation and your code isn’t in any state to be judged.\nor have no intention of ever merging it, but you’d still like people to check it out locally and give you feedback.\nor opened a pull request without any code at all in order to get the discussion started.\n\n\n\n\n\nConflict resolution\nConflicts occur when two or more changes compete with each other, typically during a merge or rebase operation in Git. With pull requests, code reviews and testing you can catch potential conflicts before they are merged into the main codebase.\nConflicts usually come up and are resolved during a pull request:\n\nReview Conflicts: When a conflict is detected in a pull request, GitHub will alert you. Start by reviewing the conflicting files to understand the nature of the conflict.\nPull and Merge Locally: Fetch the latest changes from the main branch and attempt to merge them into your feature/develop branch locally. This will allow you to resolve conflicts on your local machine.\nResolve Conflicts: This might involve choosing one change over another or merging the changes manually.\nTest Changes: After resolving conflicts, thoroughly test your changes to ensure that the merged code works as expected.\nCommit and Push: Once conflicts are resolved and changes are tested, commit the resolved conflicts and push your changes back to the feature/develop branch on GitHub.\nComplete the Pull Request: After resolving conflicts and pushing your changes, review the pull request again to ensure everything is in order. If all checks pass and your team approves the changes, you can complete the merge into the main branch.\n\nEffective conflict resolution ensures that changes can be integrated smoothly and that the project remains on track. Conflicts cannot always be avoided, but they can be managed. Clear communication and adherence to established practices is the way to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on Draft PRs - Introducing Draft Pull Requests.\nGitHub - Resolving a merge conflict\nCode Refinery - Lesson on conflict resolution",

    "text": "In designing test cases for research software, it can be useful to conceptually differentiate between tests that verify the technical correctness of the code and tests that check the scientific validity of the results. With technical software tests, you check whether a function behaves as expected. With a scientific test, you compare the outcome of a function to known (experimental) scientific results.\nThe following questions can help you decide what to test in your software:\n\nHow can I ensure the algorithms and mathematical models implemented in the software are correct?\nHow can I verify that the input data types, formats, and ranges adhere to expected standards and constraints?\nHow does the software behave at boundary conditions and extreme values of input parameters?\nHow does the software perform under varying workloads and dataset sizes, and is it scalable for large-scale simulations or data processing tasks?\nHow do I compare the software’s results against existing literature, experimental data, or previous simulations to check their accuracy?\n\n\nRoadmap to testing\n\nNew to testingFamiliar with testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Familiarize yourself with the basics\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin by learning a testing framework that is well-suited for your programming language; for example, you might explore pytest if you are using Python. It is also important to understand the basic types of tests, focusing primarily on unit tests and simple integration tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Identify critical components in your code\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the time to inspect your codebase and determine which parts are most important or particularly prone to error. These are the areas where you should focus your testing efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Start small\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin by writing minimal (unit) tests for individual functions or modules. Creating tests based on expected inputs and outputs will help confirm that your code behaves as intended. The primary goal at this stage is to understand the testing process rather than aiming for complete coverage from the start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Incrementally expand the number of tests\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you introduce new functionality, adopt an approach by writing tests alongside your new code. Over time, gradually add tests to your existing code – especially when you make changes or improvements – to steadily increase overall test coverage and improve the reliability of your software. Make sure to focus on testing the critical parts of your codebase first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Refactor your code for testability\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find it difficult to write tests for your codebase, consider refactoring it into smaller, more testable units. Clear documentation and comments on your functions will further aid in writing tests by providing a well-defined understanding of each component’s intent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Automate and adopt\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, add automated testing to your development workflow by using a continuous integration tool to run tests automatically with each code change. Establishing a regular habit of testing will, over time, lead to significant improvements in the quality and reliability of your research code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Develop a testing strategy\n\n\n\n\n\nFor researchers already experienced with testing, it is useful to develop a testing strategy. Start by adopting the test pyramid approach: ensure that all core functions and algorithms are covered by unit tests, verify that modules interact correctly with integration tests, and, when applicable, use end-to-end tests to simulate real-world user workflows. Regularly running regression tests is also important to catch any unintended side effects of code changes.\nAim for comprehensive test coverage to ensure that critical parts of your codebase are thoroughly tested. A good benchmark is to test at least 70% of your code base with unit tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Adopt a practice of writing tests first\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider methodologies such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) into your workflow. With TDD, you write tests before you write the actual code to define the desired behavior, ensure clear specifications, and obtain immediate feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Research-specific testing\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a research context, certain quality measures become particularly important. Prioritize reproducibility by writing tests that verify experiments yield consistent outputs for a given dataset and configuration. If your code relies on statistical methods, use fixed random seeds to ensure reproducibility across different runs. Additionally, consider implementing validation tests that compare your results against known benchmarks or experimental data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Consider advanced testing practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage Analysis:\nEmploy code coverage tools to identify untested paths and critical areas that require additional testing.\nParameterization:\nRun tests with a range of inputs to validate robustness across different scenarios.\nError Handling: Verify that your code behaves as expected when encountering errors.\nFixtures: Use fixtures to set up a consistent and reusable testing environment.\nMocking:\nUse mocks to simulate external systems or heavy computations, isolating tests for faster feedback.\nTagging and Filtering: Organize tests into categories and run specific subsets based on tags or filters.  Advanced testing practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Integrate with CI/CD\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, integrate your testing processes into a continuous integration/deployment pipeline. Automate your test runs so that every code commit triggers a suite of tests to catch issues early in the development cycle. Monitor test performance and code coverage over time to continuously refine and enhance your testing strategy, ensuring a high level of quality and reliability in your research software.",

    "text": "In Python, two widely used testing frameworks are pytest and unittest. This guide focuses on pytest, which is recommended for its simplicity and readability. If you are new to testing in Python, pytest is a great starting point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the difference between pytest and unittest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\npytest is a third-party testing framework that is more user-friendly, requires less boilerplate, and offers better readability.\nunittest is part of the Python standard library and follows a more traditional object-oriented style of writing tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Setup a testing framework\nInstall pytest\npip install pytest\nA good practice is to organize the codebase into a src directory for the source code and a tests directory for the test suite. For example:\nsrc/\n    mypkg/\n        __init__.py\n        add.py\n        draw_random_number.py\ntests/\n    test_add.py\n    test_draw_random_number.py\n    ...\n\n\nStep 2. Identify testable units\nIdentify functions, methods, or classes on your code that should be tested. Focus on critical computations and potential points of failure.\n\n\nStep 3. Write test cases\nWrite test functions using pytest. Here’s an example:\n# src/mypkg/add.py\ndef add(x,y):\n    return x + y\n\n# tests/test_add.py\nfrom mypkg.add import add\n\ndef test_add():\n    assert add(1, 2) == 3\n    assert add(0, 0) == 0\n    assert add(-1, -1) == -2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tip\n\n\n\nLimit the number of assert statements in a single test function. Otherwise, when a particular assert fails, the remaining assertions in the test function will not be executed.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Run tests locally\nRun all tests in the project by executing the following command:\npytest\nRun a specific test file:\npytest tests/test_add.py\n\n\nStep 5. Debug and fix failing tests\nThe test results displayed in the console will help you to identify any failures or errors. If errors occur, debug the failing tests by examining failure messages and stack traces.\n\n\nStep 6. Run coverage report locally\nGenerate a coverage report to gain insights into which parts of the codebase have been executed during testing (see Code Coverage).\npip install pytest-cov\npytest --cov=mypkg tests/\n\n\nStep 7. Automate testing with Continuous Integration\nIntegrate youre test suite with a Continuous Integration service (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests automatically on every code change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learning materials for automated testing\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate Research Software Development - CI for Automated Testing\nCode Refinery - Automated testing\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of repositories with tests\n\neScience Center - Project matchms\nPandas library - Repository tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nPytest - Getting Started\nCode Refinery - Pytest exercise\nRealPython - Effective testing with pytest",

    "text": "Code Coverage\nCode coverage measures how much of your code is executed during testing. It is a useful metric to ensure that your tests are comprehensive and indicate your code’s quality. If your software becomes a dependency for others, a code coverage of 70% or higher is recommended for unit tests.\n\nPythonMATLAB\n\n\n\npytest-cov plugin (for pytest)\nCoverage.py documentation\n\n\n\n\nCollect code coverage with Command Window execution (since R2023b)\nCode coverage with Test Browser (since R2023a)\nCollect code coverage metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError handling\nTests should check if your code behaves as expected when it encounters errors. This includes testing if the code raises the correct exceptions when given invalid input or when an error occurs.\n\nPythonMATLAB\n\n\n\nAssert raised exceptions\n\nExample in Python:\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef test_divide_by_zero():\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        divide(1, 0)\n\n\n\nVerify function throws specific exceptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixtures\nFixtures are predefined states or sets of data used to set up the testing environment, ensuring consistent conditions for tests to run reliably. Fixtures can be used to set up databases, create temporary files, or initialize other resources, that then available to all tests in a test suite.\n\nPythonMATLAB\n\n\n\nHow to use fixtures\n\n\n\n\nCreate shared fixtures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameterization\nParameterization involves running the same test with different inputs or configurations to ensure broader coverage and identify potential edge cases.\n\nPythonMATLAB\n\n\n\nParameterizing unit tests\n\n\n\n\nCreate a basic parameterized test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMocking\nMocking (or monkeypatching) is a technique used to simulate the behavior of dependencies or external systems during testing, allowing isolated testing of specific components. For example, if your software requires a connection to a database, you can mock this interaction during testing.\n\n\n\nMathWorks, MATLAB Mocking Diagram, MATLAB Documentation, link to image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🐒 Monkeypatching?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term monkey patch seems to have come from an earlier term, guerrilla patch, which referred to changing code sneakily – and possibly incompatibly with other such patches – at runtime. The word guerrilla, nearly homophonous with gorilla, became monkey, possibly to make the patch sound less intimidating.\n\n\n\n\nPythonMATLAB\n\n\n\nHow to monkeypatch/mock modules and environments\n\n\n\n\nCreate Mock Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks and tags\nYou can use test tags to group tests into categories and then run tests with specified tags. This is useful when you want to run only a subset of tests, such as regression tests, or when ignoring slow tests during development.\n\nPythonMATLAB\n\n\n\nWorking with custom markers\n\n\n\n\nTag unit tests",

In order to apply a pre-approved open source license, you have to follow the guidelines in TU Delft Guidelines on Research Software: Licensing, Registration and Commercialisation. It states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that in principle TU Delft holds the rights to the software created by its employees (i.e. software developers, researchers and/or staff). So, some formal (legal) steps are needed to arrange matters properly.\nWhen these guidelines are followed and when the software is published, TU Delft disclaims its copyright, allowing software developers, researchers and staff to hold the copyright to their software and thereby having the right to apply one of the pre-approved licences when sharing software. The pre-approved open source software licences at TU Delft are Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, AGPL, LGPL, GPL, and CC0.\n\n\n\n\nSteps to apply a pre-approved open-source license\n\nDetermine if it is possible to apply an Open Source Software licence to your project (see diagram below).\nThe waiver of TU Delft should be added to the repository, either as a separate file or within the LICENSE file. The waiver text should be as follows:\nTechnische Universiteit Delft hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program “Name program” (one line description of the content or function) written by the Author(s). \n\n[Name Dean], Dean of [Name Faculty]\nAssert your own, personal copyright (© YEAR, [NAME], [REFERENCE project, grant or study if desired]. Waiving the copyright and having TU Delft staff assert the copyright in their own name facilitates the use of copyleft licences.\nApply one of the TU Delft pre-approved Open Source Software licences in the format and form described in the licence text after stating, “This work is licensed under a [NAME and VERSION] OSS licence”.\nMake the software openly available (for instance in an online repository such as GitHub).\nPlease consider acknowledging support from TU Delft and/or your funding provider.\nRegister the software either in 4TU.ResearchData or in PURE. Registries in 4TU.ResearchData are automatically registered in PURE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steps above are mandatory, the TU Delft guidelines state:\nPlease note that if the software is not published, and/or if the guidelines have not been followed correctly and/or if the software is not registered in PURE, then this ‘agreement’ is invalid and the software automatically falls under the legal copyright of TU Delft. This instantly nullifies the right of the software developer or researcher to apply for a licence and thus the open source software licence applied never came into existence. This works retroactively.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision tree for applying for a license\nTU Delft staff members can apply for an open-source license according to the decision tree found in TU Delft Guidelines on Research Software: Licensing, Registration and Commercialisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision tree to guide software developers, researchers and staff on when they can apply an open source licence to their software (OSS: Open Source Software, IDF: Invention Disclosure Form).

For example, a BSD 3-Clause license adds a clause preventing the use of the names of the project or its contributors to endorse or promote derived products without written permission.\nPatent Protection: Does not include explicit provisions for patent protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nApache: Allows for the use, modification, distribution, and sublicensing of the software under certain conditions. It is often used in open-source projects and is often the choice for its balance between permissiveness and the protection of patents. The Innovation and Impact Center recommends this license for industry collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apache license details\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution: Requires preservation of the original copyright notice and a notice of any modifications made.\nPatent Protection: Includes a patent retaliation clause, which provides an additional layer of protection. This clause terminates the license if the user initiates patent litigation against any entity regarding the licensed software.\nNotice Requirement: Modifications to the original code must be documented, and a NOTICE file must be included with any substantial portions of the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Key differences between a BSD and Apache license\n\n\n\n\nThe Apache license includes a patent retaliation clause to protect against patent litigation, but the BSD license does not explicitly address patent rights.\nThe BSD license does not require a specific notice file for modifications, but the Apache License requires a NOTICE file that documents any modifications made to the original code.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyleft licenses\n\nGPL (GNU General Public License): One of the most widespread copyleft licenses. With the GPL license, any derivative work under this license automatically becomes subject to the same GPL terms, regardless of the size of the contribution. All future modifications and adaptions of code under this license is only compatible with this license and cannot be used in proprietary software.\nDerivatives from GPL (AGPL, LGPL, EUPL): From these, the EUPL license is somewhat more flexible compared to others as it can coexist with other open-source software licenses such as MIT, BSD, and Apache. For instance, if you integrate a portion of software that is licensed under Apache into a project governed by EUPL, that portion can retain its Apache license. In contrast, under the GPL, the entire codebase would need to be licensed under GPL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There are even instances when GPL licenses are incompatible with each other. For example, GPL-2.0 is incompatible with GPL-3.0. If a project uses GPL-2.0 you are essentially forced to use that license.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense compatibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatibility of licenses.

    "text": "Docstrings\nDocstrings are structured comments, associated with segments (rather than lines) of code which can be used to generate documentation for users (and yourself!) of your project. They allow you to provide documentation to a segment (function, class, method) that is relevant for the user. Docstrings are placed in triple quotes \"\"\" and enable automated generation of API documentation.\nTwo docstring styles are commonly used for their readability:\n\nNumPy styleGoogle style\n\n\ndef func(arg1, arg2):\n    \"\"\"Summary line.\n\n    Extended description of function.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    arg1 : int\n        Description of arg1\n    arg2 : str\n        Description of arg2\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    bool\n        Description of return value\n\n    \"\"\"\n    return True\n⮕ Check out the NumPy style guide or a full example.\n\n\ndef func(arg1, arg2):\n    \"\"\"Summary line.\n\n    Extended description of function.\n\n    Args:\n        arg1 (int): Description of arg1\n        arg2 (str): Description of arg2\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: Description of return value\n\n    \"\"\"\n    return True\n⮕ Check out the Google style guide or a full example.\n\n\n\n\nDocstring formatting\nPython’s PEP 257 provides guidelines on how to effectively write docstrings to ensure they are clear, concise, and useful. Some pointers:\n\nThe summary sentence of the docstring should appear on the same line as the opening triple quotes.\nThe closing triple quotes should be placed on a separate line, except for one-line docstrings.\nDocstrings for methods and functions should not have blank lines before or after them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example\n\n\n\n\n\ndef find_max(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Find the maximum value in a list of numbers.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    numbers : iterable\n        A collection of numerical values from which the maximum will be determined.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    max_value : `float`\n        The highest number in the given list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\n\n\nDocstrings for classes should immediately follow the class definition without any preceding blank lines. However, a single blank line should follow the docstring, separating it from subsequent code such as class variables or the init method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Circle(object):\n    \"\"\"A circle defined by its radius.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    radius : `float`\n        The radius of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n\n\n\n\nThe content of a docstring must align with the indentation level of the code it documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correct and incorrect examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef get_length(items):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the number of items in the list.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    items : list\n        A list whose length is to be determined.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    length : int\n        The number of items in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return len(items)\n\n\ndef get_length(items):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the number of items in the list.\n\nParameters\n----------\nitems : list\n    A list whose length is to be determined.\n\nReturns\n-------\nlength : int\n    The number of items in the list.\n\"\"\"\n    return len(items)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nBuild API reference from docstrings\nNumpydoc style guide - best practices for docstrings\n\n\n\n\n\nDocstring contents\nFormatting conventions are important for clarity and readability across different APIs or libraries. Here we adhere to the numpydoc convention.\n\nSummaries\nDocstrings should start with a one-sentence summary and if additional clarification is needed, you could add an extended summary. For functions and methods, use imperative voice, framing its summary as a command or instruction that the user can execute through the API. For classes, the summary should clearly describe what the class represents or its primary responsibility.\n\n\nParameters and arguments\nThe Parameters section lists the input parameters of a class, function, or method. It should include the parameter name, type, and a brief description of what the parameter represents. Parameters are listed in the same order as they appear in the function definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full description and example\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribing parameters\nBasic example:\ndef calcDistance(x, y, x0=0., y0=0., **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the distance between two points.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : `float`\n        X-axis coordinate.\n    y : `float`\n        Y-axis coordinate.\n    x0 : `float`, optional\n        X-axis coordinate for the second point (the origin,\n        by default).\n\n        Descriptions can have multiple paragraphs, and lists:\n\n        - First list item.\n        - Second list item.\n    y0 : `float`, optional\n        Y-axis coordinate for the second point (the origin,\n        by default).\n    **kwargs\n        Additional keyword arguments passed to\n        `calcExternalApi`.\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns and Yields\nReturns is an explanation about the returned values and their types, following the same format as Parameters.

Clone the repository:\ngit clone &lt;repo-url&gt;\n\nInitialize the submodules:\n\ngit submodule init\n\nFetch the submodule content:\n\ngit submodule update\nAlternatively, you can use the shorthand command to clone and initialize submodules:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules &lt;repo-url&gt;\n\n\nUpdating submodules\nTo update the submodules to the latest commit, use:\ngit submodule update --remote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nSimplified Git submodules tutorial\nGuide on Git submodules - comprehensive guide that covers everything from the basics to advanced workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using GitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using GitHub Desktop, be aware that there can be limitations when working with submodules.

They are like a to-do list items that everyone on your team can see and update.\nHow to use issues effectively:\n\nUse descriptive titles: Write short, specific titles that make it easy to understand what the issue is about.\nProvide detailed descriptions: Include all relevant information, steps to reproduce (if reporting a bug), and expected outcomes in the issue description. This ensures that anyone working on the issue has all the necessary context.\nUse labels: Labels act like tags to help you organize and prioritize tasks.\nAssign people: By assigning someone (or yourself) you let others know that you are picking up and working on this issue.\nLink related issues: Connect related work by linking issues to provide context (add #issue_number to reference an issue).\n\nGitHub Issues make it easier to manage your project, collaborate with others, and keep track of progress.

    "text": "Managing projects on GitHub\nWhen managing your project on GitHub, we recommend two approaches:\n\na simplified approach using only issues, or\na more structured approach using milestones and project boards.\n\nBoth methods have advantages, and the choice depends on the size of the project, its complexity, and your preferences.\n\nSimplified approachStructured approach\n\n\nYou can use a simplified approach and just track your progress in the form of issues and work without defining milestones or using a project board. This can be particularly useful for smaller projects or when you are just starting out with GitHub.\nIn this approach, you would:\n\nCreate issues for each task or feature you need to work on.\nOptionally, use labels to categorize and prioritize your issues.\nAssign issues to yourself or team members/collaborators.\nUse comments to update progress and discuss any challenges.\nClose issues as you complete them.\n\nThis method allows for a flexible workflow while still maintaining a good level of organization and transparency in your project. If your project grows or becomes more complex, you can always adopt milestones and project boards for more structured project management.\n\n\nWhen working on a big project, it’s helpful to create a roadmap - a simple plan that outlines what needs to be done and when. A roadmap gives you and your team a clear view of what’s happening now and what’s coming next.\nTo create a roadmap, it is useful to map out the key milestones and the tasks needed to accomplish the milestones. You can then use GitHub milestones and project boards to track progress and manage your project:\n\nDefine key milestones.\nCreate a milestone in GitHub\nAdd related issues to your milestone.\nSet up a project board.\nAdd issues to your project board.\nUse task lists in your issues to break down the work.\nAssign tasks to team members.\nLinking milestones, issues and pull requests to track progress.",

RStudio Projects organize your workspace by managing file paths and configurations, while renv tracks and restores package dependencies to ensure reproducibility. Together, they provide a structured and reliable workflow for managing R projects.\nAlthough Conda can be used to create isolated R environments, it is less common in R workflows. Conda is most useful when managing multiple R versions, working in a Python + R setup, or handling system dependencies that are difficult to install through CRAN.\n\nProjects\nRStudio Projects provide an organized workspace for your analyses and scripts, ensuring that file paths and working directories remain consistent across sessions. When you open an RStudio Project, it automatically sets the project’s root directory as your working directory and loads project-specific settings stored in the .Rproj file. Using RStudio Projects helps you to keep your code, data, and output bundled together, and avoid issues with file paths.\nCreating a new RStudio Project:\n\nIn RStudio, go to File → New Project.\nChoose whether to create a new directory, use an existing directory, or clone a project.\nFollow the prompts to configure your project settings.\n\n\n\nrenv\nThe renv package manages R package dependencies within a project. It creates a reproducible snapshot of your package environment, ensuring that collaborators (or your future self) can recreate the exact setup. Some key renv commands:\nInitialize renv in your project:\n# From your R console within the project directory:\nrenv::init()\nThis creates a dedicated library and a renv.lock file that tracks all installed packages. If a renv.lock file exists, renv::init() will automatically install the recorded dependencies. Otherwise, it sets up a new environment.\nCreate a snapshot of your dependencies:\nrenv::snapshot()\nThis updates the renv.lock file to reflect the current package versions in your project.\nTo restore an environment from a lockfile:\nrenv::restore()\nThis reinstalls packages according to the renv.lock file and reconstructs the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nUsing RStudio Projects\nrenv for R",

    "text": "Why use containers?\nContainers remove the need for manual installation or troubleshooting, ensuring that software runs consistently across different machines. Containers act as a self-contained unit that bundle everything needed to run software, including dependencies and system libraries, into a single package known as an image.\nThe definition files, like Dockerfiles or Singularity definition files, are essentially instruction manuals to build a container image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analogy for a container image\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a container image like a detailed movie script that outlines every scene. When the movie is shot (i.e., the container is executed), a temporary set is built where all filming occurs in a controlled environment. Once filming ends, the set is dismantled, but the script remains unchanged, allowing the software to be re-executed with the same consistent results every time, just as each scene is reproduced faithfully with the same script.\n\n\n\nContainers can be useful for various purposes:\n\nIf installing certain software is complex or incompatible with your operating system, you can use a pre-built container image to run the software seamlessly.\nLikewise, if you want to make sure that the people you are working with use the exact same environment, you could provide them with an image of your container.\nIf you are facing issues due to different system architectures you can distribute a definition file to build an image that tailors to different machines. While it might not replicate your environment exactly, it often provides a sufficiently close alternative.\n\nPopular containerisation solutions:\n\nDocker and Podman are great for general software development.\nSingularity is tailored for high-performance computing (HPC) environments.\nFor managing and scaling containers across multiple machines, tools like Kubernetes are commonly used.\n\nDocker’s official samples and examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\nRecording environments lesson on CodeRefinery\nCarpentries incubator lesson on Docker\nGuides and manuals for Docker\nSingularity documentation"

There have been instances where images were found to be malicious, so it is very important to apply the same caution as when installing software packages from untrusted sources.\nAlways download images from trusted sources like Docker Hub. Utilize container scanning tools, such as Docker scanning tools to mitigate risks from malicious images."

It improves maintainability and readability, making future developments smoother and reducing the likelihood of bugs. Key benefits include:\n\nImproving readability - Writing code that’s easier to understand, benefits both yourself and future developers.\nReducing complexity - Simplifying complex structures by breaking down large functions or removing unnecessary dependencies.\nOptimizing design - Creating a more robust and adaptable codebase for long-term growth.\nEliminating redundancies - Removing duplicate or unnecessary code.\nEnsuring consistency - Following a consistent coding style for a cleaner, more maintanable codebase.\n\n\n\nWhen should you refactor?\n\n\n\nCC-BY-4.0 © 2021 Balaban et al.\n\n\n\nRule of three: If you find yourself writing the same or similiar code for the third time, it’s time to refactor.\nBefore adding a feature: Cleaning up existing code makes it easier to integrate a new functionality.\nWhen fixing a bug: Cleaning up surrounding code can help uncover and fix the issue faster.\nDuring code reviews: Refactoring during code reviews can prevent issues from becoming part of the public codebase and streamline the development process.\nWhen you spot a code smell: Addressing code smells early prevents them from evolving into more serious bugs.\n\n\n Learn more: When to refactor?\n\n\n\nHow to refactor code effectively?\nRefactoring should be done gradually, improving code in small controlled steps without introducing new functionalities.

If the way temperature is stored changes (e.g., a new sensor model), SensorSystem must also change.\n\nSolutions\n\nExample solution - Using getter methods\nInstead of directly accessing attributes, define getter methods in TemperatureSensor to limit exposure.\nclass TemperatureSensor:\n    def __init__(self, temperature):\n        self._temperature = temperature  # Use a private variable\n\n    def get_temperature(self):\n        return self._temperature  # Encapsulated access\n\nclass SensorSystem:\n    def __init__(self, sensor):\n        self.sensor = sensor\n\n    def get_temperature(self):\n        return self.sensor.get_temperature()  # Indirect access through method\n\n# Usage\nsensor = TemperatureSensor(25)\nsystem = SensorSystem(sensor)\nprint(system.get_temperature())  # 25\nWhy is this better?\n\nThe SensorSystem no longer needs to know the internal structure of TemperatureSensor.\nIf TemperatureSensor changes, only get_temperature() needs to be updated, not every place it’s used.\n\n\n\nExample solution - Removing the dependency\nA better design is to pass only the needed data instead of an entire object.\nclass SensorSystem:\n    def __init__(self, temperature):\n        self.temperature = temperature\n\n    def get_temperature(self):\n        return self.temperature  # Works directly with the value\n\n# Usage\ntemperature = 25\nsystem = SensorSystem(temperature)\nprint(system.get_temperature())  # 25\nWhy is this better?\n\nSensorSystem no longer depends on TemperatureSensor, making it more modular and reusable.\nWorks even if the source of temperature data changes (e.g., from a file, API, or another sensor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance between dependecy injection and encapsulation. If the data is simple and does not require complex operations, pass it directly. If the data is complex or requires additional logic, encapsulate it in a class.",

Create an access file for each of the candidates\nIf you use ls command to check the available files in this folder, you can see there are some files that their name start with a number and then a dash and then a user name (&lt;number&gt;-&lt;username&gt;). In Linux for every user with a sudo permission, there is a file like that, so we duplicate one of the existing files and rename them for each of the sudo candidates (in fact, name of those file doesn’t matter; however, it helps us to understand which users have sudo privilege without opening them).\n\n\nStep 4. Editing the access files\nIn this step you need to open each of the newly duplicated files and replace the old username in the second line with the sudo candidate username. After the edit, you just save the changes and exit the file."

Assign contributors to the group.\nAfter creating a group, it appears in the Groups tab. The group owner can add different people to the projects. This can be done by entering a project and then clicking on the Members on the left panel and filling in the form (Figure 4). A very important part of this form is permissions which are explained here in detail.\n Figure 4: Assigning members to a project.\nYou can also create subgroups within a group. To create a subgroup, you need to enter an existing group and press the New subgroup button. Then, similar to creating a group, you fill in the subgroup name and select the degree of visibility for the subgroup. The subgroup visibility level is always a subset of its (parent) group visibility, hence if the parent visibility is private, there is no choice except private for the subgroup visibility but if the parent visibility is public, subgroup visibility could be either public, internal, or private. The same logic applies when you create a subgroup within another subgroup.\n Figure 5: Creating a subgroup.\nAfter setting up the group, (sub groups,) projects, and assigning the collaborators to the projects, they can start working with the remote repository and transfer their scripts there.",

If you select your name, the fields below should be auto-populated with your building, phone number, email, department/program, organizational unit, and (sometimes) room.\n\nThe last question in the Caller Details section access to the server by external users. Generally speaking, granting access to TU Delft-managed servers is not recommended, but if it is necessary you can add the contact details of the external party and the reason(s) for which they should have access. You will need to provide a company-affiliated email address for the external user, and the request may or may not be granted by ICT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that a server provides access to the backend of your application. If for example you want to deploy a web server to share your data widely, users do not need direct access to the server in order to access the data itself.\n\n\nThe next section contains General Questions about the name and purpose of your server. If you plan to use this server ongoing into the future, you can either leave the field “Expiration Date” blank or add a date in 10+ years. TU Delft ICT will alert you when the expiration date you select is nearing.\n\n\n\n436ab820-8194-4212-8622-93758ba56f56\n\n\nYou can add the netIDs of your collaborators who should have read/write access to the server, and optionally the netID of your faculty Data Steward or of a DCC Team member if you would like their help. You can find your faculty Data Steward contact information here.\nThe Technical Questions section asks you to specify an operating system and some other technical details about your server configuration. You can choose between four basic configuration options - you can of course consider which one best fits your needs. If you are new to working with servers, generally the best choice is Basic configuration 4.\nThe next question deals with opening ports to the server through the TU Delft firewall. Ports are essentially gateways to the server that are specific to different purposes. For example, port 80 is opened to handle HTTP requests, port 20 is opened to handle SSH requests, port 3306 is opened to allow access to a MySQL database, and port 443 is opened to handle HTTPS requests. If you are planning to use your VPS as a webserver, ports 80 and 443 should be open. You can use this space to ask ICT to do so.\nThe next section, FQDN, is the way you can refer to your server on the internet. The recommendation is a format like &lt;servername&gt;.&lt;facultyabbreviation&gt;.tudelt.nl. In general, it’s best to keep names relatively short and informative to make it easy to reference and remember.\nYou should also be sure to check the instructions in the form and contact your faculty Data Steward or Faculty IT Manager if you need further explanation.",

The unix based systems (e.g., mac) contain ssh by default. In order to login to your VPS, you need to first ssh to the bastion server with ssh &lt;username&gt;@linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl and then from there login to your server ssh &lt;servername&gt;. The first thing we recommend to do after logging into the server is to update the pre-installed packages:\n\nDebian (Ubuntu)RedHat\n\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nsudo yum update\n\n\n\nIt would be also useful to set a password for the VPS when you log in.

    "text": "Tunneling with WinSCP\nWinSCP is a GUI that makes it very easy to inspect, edit and transfer files on the webserver. Instructions for setting this up on a hypothetical server from the CiTG faculty are provided below. General documentation on tunneling with WinSCP are here: https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_tunnel\nThese instructions were tested with an existing id_ed25519 key, assume you already have WinSCP installed and can modify a text file on the server in your user directory using the terminal.\nDo the following:\n\nAs explained above, log in to the server and add your public key to the file /home/&lt;username&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys (this only needs to be done once).\n\nIt should look like this with your own keys XXXXXXX and NetID filled between the &lt;...&gt; (note the &lt;XXXXXXX&gt; is much longer in reality):\nssh-rsa &lt;XXXXXXX&gt; ICT-SYSTEMS-&lt;NETID&gt;\nssh-rsa &lt;XXXXXXX&gt; ICT-SYSTEMS-&lt;NETID&gt;\nssh-ed25519 &lt;XXXXXXX&gt; &lt;NETID&gt;@tudelft.nl\n\nUsing WinSCP, the following fields should be entered:\n\nOn the main login settings page: - File protocol: SFTP - Host name: &lt;server&gt;.citg.tudelft.nl - User name: your NetID\n\nOpen the “Advanced…” window\nOn the page “Tunnel” (under heading “Connection,” still in the Advanced window):\n\n\nHost name: linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl\nUser name: your NetID\n\n\nOn the page “Authentication” (under heading “SSH,” still in the Advanced window):\n\n\nPrivate key file: select your private key file, for example C:..../&lt;username&gt;/.ssh/id_ed25519\nNote that the app may ask you to convert your existing key to a Putty format (for example “Do you want to convert OpenSSH private key to PuTTY format?”). Click “OK” then make sure you select the new PuTTY file (e.g., C:..../&lt;username&gt;/.ssh/id_ed25519.ppk)\n\n\nSave the setting and click “Login”, using your NetID password to authenticate.\n\n\nUsing WinSCP with sudo rights\nIf you have sudo rights on the webserver you can use this via WinSCP as follows:\n\nOnce agin go to the “Advanced…” window to the “SFTP” page under heading “Environment”\nIn field “SFTP server” enter the following: sudo /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server\nSave the changes\nUse with caution!\n\nNote that the path to sftp-server may be different but can be easily checked and arranged. This will not work if you change the setting and continue to use an open session.",

By following the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) principles, users will learn the core concepts and practices of good data management at TU Delft.\nResearch data includes any information observed, generated or created for use in research projects. Though often tied to specific research projects, research data follows its own lifecycle, which is distinct from the project itself. After initial data collection, data may be processed, analyzed, published, shared, archived, reused or destroyed.\nEffective research data management by following FAIR principles ensures efficiency and reproducibility at every step of the data lifecycle. At TU Delft, various tools and resources are available to meet diverse data management needs at any stage in its lifecycle.\nThis guide intends to walk you through the following steps of the data lifecycle at TU Delft, following FAIR principles:\n\nData Collection\nData Processing\nData Storage\nData Publishing",

Locate the URL of your project storage\nThe URL for your project drive can be obtained from either - the email from TU Delft ICT with the confirmation of your project drive request, or - by using a web browser to navigate into https://webdata.tudelft.nl/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nhttps://webdata.tudelft.nl/ can only be accessed in campus or using eduVPN\n\n\n\nchromeedge\n\n\n\nNavigate into https://webdata.tudelft.nl/staff-umbrella/\n\nA pop-up should appear asking for Username and Password.\n\nProvide your netID in the Username field, provide your password accordingly.\n\nYou should now see a list of your project drives.\n\nClick on the project drive of your choice.\n\nCopy everything after “https://webdata.tudelft.nl/”\n\n\n\nContent within webdata is under password protection. Typing your username and password in only possible with a pop-up message which is disabled in systems managed by TU Delft, please try the instructions provided for chrome\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Connect to your TU Delft VPS via SSH\nFollow instructions in TU Delft ICT email from initial server setup or configure a 1-step connection via SSH.\n\n\nStep 3. Create a new directory as the mounting point\nThe convention is to create mounting points in the folder /media. Navigate to the folder and create a new folder with\ncd /media\nmkdir &lt;server_mount_point&gt;\nReplace &lt;server_mount_point&gt; with the name of your choice. This will be the name of the folder where your project drive will be mounted.\n\n\nStep 4. Find and save your user and group details\nIn the terminal, you can retrieve your local user and group details with:\nid -u &lt;your_netID&gt; # User ID\nid -g &lt;your_netID&gt; # Group ID\nYou may need the values for uid and gid for step 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese commands are server-specific, so make sure to execute them on the server where the project drives will be mounted.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Edit the fstab file to include project storage technical details\nThe fstab file containes a list of the addresses of external file systems. In this file, the details of your project drive will need to be added in a single line. This line consists of four parts: 1. filesystem - the address of the project drive 2. mount point - the location in the VPS where you want to mount the project drive 3. type - the type of the filesystem 4. options - additional option such as user privileges\nThe fstab file must be in the /etc/ directory and can be opened with the vi or nano editor:\n\nvinano\n\n\nIn the terminal, enter the following command to open the fstab file in the vi editor:\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\nThen, switch to the insert mode (hit “i” to switch to insert mode and be able to type)\n\n\nIn the terminal, enter the following command to open the fstab file in the nano editor:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n\n\nAdd the following line to the file:\n&lt;your_netID&gt;@sftp.tudelft.nl:/staff-umbrella/&lt;project_drive_name&gt;  /media/&lt;server_mount_point&gt; fuse.sshfs  rw,noauto,users,_netdev  0  0\nreplacing the values between &lt; and &gt; with your NetID, the name of your project drive, and the name of the folder you created in step 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf this configuration throws a permission error during mounting, try:\n//tudelft.net/staff-umbrella/&lt;project_drive_name&gt;/ /media/&lt;server_mount_point&gt; cifs username=&lt;your_netID&gt;,noauto,uid=&lt;your_uid&gt;,gid=&lt;your_gid&gt;,forcegid,rw,_netdev\nUse the values for uid and gid from step 4.\n\n\nClose the file editor and save the changes:\n\nvinano\n\n\nUse Control+C followed by :wq to save the file and close it to get back to your terminal.\n\n\nAs indicated by the nano interface, use Control+O to write the file. Then, confirm your choice of filename by hitting enter. Finally, exit the file with Control+X\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Mount the project drive\nTo mount the project drive execute the command\nsudo mount /media/&lt;server_mount_point&gt;\nYou can also unmount the drive with\nfusermount -u /media/&lt;server_mount_point&gt;\nThe project drive will not mount automatically, so you will need to remount it manually each time you restart the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the step above does not work, it probably means that the packages for mounting cifs-type filesystems haven’t been installed. Depending on your linux flavour you will need to install them using:\n\nUbuntu/DebianRedhat/Centos/Fedora\n\n\nsudo apt install cifs-utils\n\n\nsudo yum install cifs-utils",

Request Project Drive storage via the TU Delft ICT form on TopDesk\nYou can make a request for data storage via the TopDesk self service portal. Navigate to this form (requires netID sign in) and see below for guidance on how to fill in each of the sections.\n\n\nStep 2. Fill and send the form according to your data storage preferences and requirements\nThe form is divided into three sections: “Caller”, “Information about Requester and Data”, and “Data for a Research Project”.\nThe Caller section should contain the contact information of the main administrator of this server. If you select your name, the fields below should be auto-populated with your building, phone number, email, department/program, organizational unit, and (sometimes) room.\n\n\nIn the next part you choose your preferences about data preservation. The first question asks whether you are setting up new storage on the Project Drive, or want to change existing storage. The next question is about the availability - see below for more information. The usual choice here is “Standard”.\n\nFor the next question, you need to determine if your data is critical, sensitive, or standard, using these criteria:\n\nThere are two options for backup retention: standard and high. Data are backed up by ICT on a daily basis, so the retention time refers to the period for which these backups are stored. The standard option refers to 14 days of retention while in the other one the retention period is one year. In other words, if the retention time is set to 14 days (Standard) and you delete a file, you can restore it within those two weeks. If retention time is 1 year (High), you can restore it anytime within the year. For most situations, a Standard backup retention time is suitable.\n\nIn the final section, you need to provide some information about your research project. Depending on your research needs, you should specify how much space you will need on the Project Drive to hold all your data, initially and into the planned future. It is important to know that the Project Drive storage is able to expand as your data grows, but you should make your best guess when requesting the space.\nAt the bottom of this section you can attach an Excel file that contains the netIDs of TU Delft affiliated employees that should have read/write access to the storage you are requesting on the Project Drive. If access to the storage is required for TU Delft external researchers, this information can be added as well. Note that it is unusual that non-TU Delft personnel are added to Project Drive storage, and if you would like to do so you should provide a company-affiliated email address for each person you want to add.",

FAIR data enhances research reliability, impact, and visibility, creating new collaboration opportunities for researchers. The acronym FAIR stands for:\n\nFindable: Data should be findable by users. A straightforward and reliable way to achieve this is by depositing data in a repository with appropriate metadata, tags, and identifiers to improve searchability.\nAccessible: Data should be accessible to authorized users. This does not mean all data must be publicly available; rather, it should be “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. If data cannot be made publicly available due to sensitive information or commercial restrictions, the metadata should still be made public to indicate where and how the data can be accessed if needed.\nInteroperable: Data should be in standardized formats with a clear structure to allow it to be interoperable across different systems, enabling data to be used in various applications by both the data owners and other users.\nReusable: For data to be reusable, users must understand what the data represents, the information it contains, and how to interpret its structure and format. Good documentation and an appropriate license are key in reusability, as these enable others to understand and work with your dataset, especially upon publication.",

    "text": "Steps\n\nGenerate .csr file\nSecure-copy .csr file from server to local machine\nSubmit Certificate Server Request to TU Delft ICT via TopDesk form\n\n\nStep 1. Generate .csr file\nThe Certificate Signing Request (.csr) file is a file generated by you in a standard format that contains all the information the signing authority needs to create a signed certificate. You will need to include this .csr file in submitting your SSL certificate request form to TU Delft ICT, and you should generate it on your VPS directly. The instructions for generating a .csr file come from here.\nSSH to your VPS (____ link if you have followed the process to connect directly, you can use: username@localmachine ~ % ssh externalserveralias)\nEnter following command in the terminal: Note: replace mydomain with your actual domain name:\nusername@externalserver ~ % openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mydomain.key -out mydomain.csr\nYou will be prompted to answer a series of questions:\n\nCountry name: 2 letter abbreviation for your country. Netherlands is NL.\nState or Province Name: this is where your org operates from. Zuid-Holland.\nLocality Name - name of the city your org operates from. Don’t use abbreviations in this field.\nOrganisation Name - use your (organisation’s) full name.\nOrganisational Unit Name - Use a department name ex. “IT Department” or “Library”\nCommon Name - the FQDN that you are requesting an SSL certificate for.\nEmail address\nOptional password (can skip step)\nOptional company name\n\nYour CSR file has now been generated. To find your CSR, take a look at the contents of your current working directory with the ls command. You should notice two new files ending with “.key” and “.csr” respectively. For example:\nusername@externalserver ~ % ls\n-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1082 Jan 31 12:10 mydomain.csr\n-rw-------. 1 root root 1704 Jan 31 12:10 mydomain.key\nThe .key file should be kept private on your server. The .csr file is your certificate signing request, and can be sent to a Certificate Authority.\n\n\nStep 2. Secure-copy .csr file from server to local machine\nIn this step we use Secure Copy protocol (SCP) which is a means of securely transferring files between hosts on a network. This example will save the file in the Home directory, but you can also save it into any other project folder on your machine.\nNavigate to directory of choice. In this case, we’ll use home.\nusername@localmachine .ssh % cd ~\nUse scp to secure copy .csr file from your external server. If you have followed ___these steps to enable 1-step SSH access to your VPS, you can do this using the alias you set, and the .csr file name which should be your external server FQDN.csr. Don’t forget to add the . at the end of the command.\nusername@localmachine ~ % scp externalserveralias:~/external-server-FQDN.nl.csr .\nCheck to see that it saved on your local machine using ls:\nusername@localmachine ~ % ls\nApplications        Movies\nDesktop             Music\nDocuments           Pictures\nDownloads           Public\nDropbox             external-server-FQDN.nl.csr\nLibrary             surfdrive\nIf you have not set up 1-step SSH connection to your VPS, the file transfer procedure from the VPS to your local computer is composed of two steps:\n\nFrom the VPS to the intermediary server, and\nFrom the intermediary server to the local computer.\n\nFor the first step use:\nscp &lt;path to the csr file&gt; &lt;netid&gt;@&lt;intermediary_server_address&gt;:&lt;a path in the intermediary_server&gt; (e.g., scp thredds.tudelft.nl.csr mynetid@linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl:~).\nIn the second step, you need to copy the file from the intermediary server to the local computer using the same command but with a different source and destination:\nscp &lt;netid&gt;@&lt;intermediary_server_address&gt;:&lt;the path in the intermediary_server to the selected file&gt; &lt;a path in the local computer&gt; (e.g., scp mynetid@linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl:~/thredds.tudelft.nl.csr .)\nPlease note, if you are a Windows user, for the second step you need to install cygwin and ssh to the intermediary server using:\nssh &lt;netid&gt;@&lt;intermediary_server_address&gt; (e.g., ssh mynetid@linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl).\n\n\nStep 3. Submit Certificate Server Request to TU Delft ICT via TopDesk form\nTU Delft ICT will use the information stored in your .csr file to get the SSL certificate from the signing authority and send the SSL certificate to you. In order to make this request, you must attach your .csr file from the previous step.\nNavigate to TopDesk form for TU Delft. TOPdesk SSL certificate server request.\nChoose “Attach file” and navigate to directory where .csr file is stored** (in this example, it is in “Home”). Select “external-server-FQDN.nl.csr”.\nSubmit request. You can delete this file from your home directory after you submit the form.\nICT will respond with a SSL certificate (with the extension .crt, .cer, and/or .pem) that comes from the signing authority. When you have this, you can configure the SSL certificate to work with the web server on your VPS.",

Request a Virtual Private Server from TU Delft ICT\nYou can make a request for a server via the TopDesk self service portal. If you would like more information, documentation can be found here ___\nNote: to run a web server, ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) must be opened.\n\n\nStep 2. Install Apache web server on the VPS\nApache is an open source web server that’s available for Linux servers. It is one of the most commonly used softwares for creating a web server. And, it’s free!\nInstalling Apache can be done using commands in the terminal. These instructions are documented with further information at the link in the beginning of this paragraph. First, make sure your local software packages are up to date by running:\nsudo apt-get update\nWhen that has finished, install the Apache package using:\nsudo apt-get install apache2\nThe system prompts for confirmation – do so, and allow the system to complete the installation.\nFind the IP address of your VPS by running:\nhostname -I | awk '{print $1}'\nUse this IP address to enter the following command in your terminal, replacing local.server.ip with the actual IP address of your server:\nhttp://local.server.ip\nIf the installation was completed successfully, you should see the Apache2 Ubuntu Default page in your web browser.\nAlthough the Apache installation process is complete, there is one more additional step. Configure the default UFW firewall to allow traffic on port 80.\nStart by displaying available app profiles on UFW:\nsudo ufw show app list\nUse the following command to allow normal web traffic on port 80:\nsudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'\nVerify the changes by checking UFW status:\nsudo ufw status\nAt this point, your Apache web server is serving over HTTP, which is a good first step! But remember, we need to secure the connection over HTTPS. So, we still have a few more steps.\n\n\nStep 3. Request an SSL certificate from TU Delft ICT\nDetailed directions on how to do this can be found here ___\nYou can create the .csr file directly on the VPS by first create a directory on /etc/apache2 called ssl:\nmkdir /etc/apache2/ssl\nThen, generate a CSR and private key using:\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout &lt;server_domain&gt;.key -out &lt;server_domain&gt;.csr -nodes\nAfter successfully running the command it will ask for the information of certificate request. Complete it using the appropriate information and then .key and .csr files will be generated.\nThe .csr file must be sent to TU Delft ICT using this TopDesk form: TOPdesk SSL certificate server request.\n\n\nStep 4. Configure the SSL certificate on your VPS\nWhen you receive SSL certificate files from the signing authority via TU Delft ICT, you need to put the information from this certificate in a specific place on your VPS in order to securely expose the web server. These instructions come from here: - Configure ssl for https\nNavigate to the default Apache site config directory using the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf\nThis config file tells the server where to find SSL certificate.

Request server running Ubuntu\nIf you don’t have a VPS already, you can request one from TU Delft ICT. Instructions for requesting a server and storage from ICT can be found under Remote servers/Request a Virtual Private Server.\nWe recommend the following configuration for configuring a GitLab runner:\n\nBasic Configuration 4 (Ubuntu)\nNo additional ports need to be configured for deploying a GitLab runner with Docker.\nAdditional space if your Docker images are larger than ~10Gb.\n\n\n\nStep 2. Connect to the server via ssh\nThe email response from Sysadmin@TUDelft.nl confirming the successful deployment of your server should contain instructions to connect via ssh.\nThe default login procedure is to connect to the Bastion host (an intermediary server) and then to your server, so it is a two-step process. Please check your email for Steps A and B as described by ICT admin.\nYou can also connect to your server using Putty (Windows) or, on Mac/Linux, configure one-step access by storing ssh keys between your local machine and your server and designating an alias.\nWhen you are successfully connected, you should see in your terminal/command prompt something like this:\n\n\n\nStep 3. Install Docker on the server\nServers often do not come with Docker installed, so you may need to do it by yourself. To check whether Docker is installed, run docker --version. If you get an error message, you can install it using the following commands:\nsudo su (this will give you the root access) apt install docker.io\nNow, Docker is installed. You can check if it is installed successfully by again typing docker --version in the terminal. The result should show the version of Docker you just installed.\n\n\nStep 4. Pull the gitlab-runner Docker image\nIn order to run CI/CD jobs for your repository, you need to install GitLab Runner. GitLab Runner is an application that works with GitLab CI/CD to run jobs in a pipeline. Rather than install GitLab Runner directly on the server, we will run a lightweight version of it as a Docker container. To do so, we first need to pull the gitlab-runner Docker image by running:\ndocker pull gitlab/gitlab-runner\nYou can check whether it was successful by running docker images - you should see the gitlab/gitlab-runner image listed in the output.\n\n\nStep 5. Create a unit test function stored as a file in the repository\n\n\nStep 6. Set up the CI by configuration of the .gitlab-ci.yml file\nThis file in the root of your repository defines what CI/CD tests to run upon each new commit. It does this by prescribing what container to run, what scripts to run inside the container, and what things to store as artefacts.\nIn the first line of the file, you can write image: &lt;image_name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt; to indicate you want to run the runner in a Docker container container. &lt;image_name&gt; should be replaced by the name of the image you want to use to start a container and &lt;tag&gt; should be replaced by the tag of the image you want to use(image names can be found on DockerHub). Tag will be set to latest by default.\nImportant: The file must be named exactly .gitlab-ci.yml so it will be recognizable by GitLab runner. Below is an example .gitlab-ci.yml file.\n# This is a sample build configuration for Python.\n# Check our guides at https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4UWN for more examples.\n# Only use spaces to indent your .yml configuration.\n# -----\ntest:\n  # You can specify a custom docker image from Docker Hub as your build environment.\n  image: python:3.12.3\n  cache:\n    paths:\n      - .cache/pip\n      - venv/\n  script: # Modify the commands below to build your repository.\n    - pip install -r requirements.txt\n    - nosetests --with-coverage  --cover-html\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - cover/\nTags can be added as a final section in your .gitlab-ci.yml file (they are optional, we didn’t enter any in this example). You then need to enter these tags exactly when registering the runner.\n\n\nStep 7. Setup the GitLab runner\n\nFollow the instructions here till step 7 to create a GitLab runner for your repository\nChoose ‘Linux’ under operating systems\nCopy the authentication token generated and keep it handy. It will be required in Step 9.\n\n\n\nStep 8. Deploy GitLab runner in a Docker container\ndocker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always \\\n-v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner \\\n-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\ngitlab/gitlab-runner:latest\non Mac OS, use /Users/Shared/ instead of /srv/\nCheck that gitlab-runner container is running using docker ps -a\n\n\nStep 9. Register the runner using authentication token\nRun the following command to register your runner and configure it to deploy in a Docker container on your server.\ndocker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register\non Mac OS, use /Users/Shared/ instead of /srv/\nIn response to this command you will be prompted to answer the following questions\n- GitLab URL: https://gitlab.tudelft.nl\n- gitlab-ci token: Paste the authentication token generated in Step 7.\n- Enter name of the runner: example-runner\n- Type of executor: docker\n- Default Docker image: Specify the same image as the one specified in the 'image' field of the .gitlab-ci.yml file.\nSee an example below.\ndocker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register\nEnter the GitLab instance URL (for example, https://gitlab.com/):\nhttps://gitlab.tudelft.nl\nEnter the registration token:\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nVerifying runner... is valid                        runner=xxxxxxx\nEnter a name for the runner. This is stored only in the local config.toml file:\n[xxxxxxx]: example-runner\nEnter an executor: instance, kubernetes, docker-windows, docker-autoscaler, parallels, shell, ssh, virtualbox, docker+machine, custom, docker:\ndocker\nEnter the default Docker image (for example, ruby:2.7):\njulia:1.6\nRunner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's running already the config should be automatically reloaded!\n\nConfiguration (with the authentication token) was saved in \"/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml\"\n\n\nStep 10. Check that the CI/CD process is activated and your pipeline runs successfully\n\nIn your repository, navigate to Settings &gt; CI/CD &gt; Click on Expand under Runners: You should see that the runner is active as indicated by a green dot. This means that the CI pipeline is ready to run, but it needs to be triggered.\nIn order to trigger the CI pipeline, you should make a new commit to the GitLab repository.\nAfter you have made a new commit to the repository, navigate to Your Project -&gt; Build -&gt; Pipelines to check the status of CI/CD pipelines connected to your repository. If you find a green message that says “passed” with a check mark then congratulations, your pipeline works! If you see a red message that says “failed”, check to see the error message associated with it - sometimes you need to reconfigure your .gitlab-ci.yml file to make sure it uses the correct formatting and defines the tests appropriately.",

Please consult this guide for instructions.\nDeploy the gitlab-runner with\ndocker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always \\\n-v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner \\\n-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\ngitlab/gitlab-runner:latest\nVerify deployment with\nsudo docker ps -a\n\n\n\nStep 3. Create a Docker image containing a custom Matlab installation\nIn order for a Gitlab runner to execute MATLAB code, it needs to be able to access a container with MATLAB installed. The aim of this step is to create a Docker image with MATLAB installation that can be used by a Gitlab runner. By building our own Docker image, we can specify the MATLAB version and customize the installed toolboxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe have looked into using the Docker images developed by Mathworks. When running these images, you are prompted to supply your MATLAB’s account username and password to activate the instance. Although it is possible to create a new image from such an activated container and use it on the VPS, we have so far not been able to get this solution working with Gitlab runners. We thus rely on downloading a license file (step 6) and storing it as a Variable on Gitlab (step 7).\n\n\nThis Dockerfile is based on MATLAB’s Dockerfile template. We will make the following modifications to this template:\n\nset bash as the default run command (Gitlab runners need to access a shell)\nadd additional MATLAB products with the flag --products. In this example, we have added the Parallel Computing Toolbox and the Mapping Toolbox.\n\nIn your user folder on the VPS (/home/username), create a file called Dockerfile\nsudo nano Dockerfile\nand copy the content below in the Dockerfile. Make sure to update the MATLAB release and installed addons to your requirements (see in bold).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Copyright 2019 - 2021 The MathWorks, Inc.\n\n# To specify which MATLAB release to install in the container, edit the value of the MATLAB_RELEASE argument.\n# Use lower case to specify the release, for example: ARG MATLAB_RELEASE=r2020a\nARG MATLAB_RELEASE=r2021b\n\n# When you start the build stage, this Dockerfile by default uses the Ubuntu-based matlab-deps image.\n# To check the available matlab-deps images, see: https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab-deps\nFROM mathworks/matlab-deps:${MATLAB_RELEASE}\n\n# Declare the global argument to use at the current build stage\nARG MATLAB_RELEASE\n\n# Install mpm dependencies\nRUN export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive && apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install --no-install-recommends --yes \\\n    wget \\\n    unzip \\\n    ca-certificates && \\\n    apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove\n\n# Run mpm to install MATLAB in the target location and delete the mpm installation afterwards\nRUN wget -q https://www.mathworks.com/mpm/glnxa64/mpm && \\ \n    chmod +x mpm && \\\n    ./mpm install \\\n    --release=${MATLAB_RELEASE} \\\n    --destination=/opt/matlab \\\n    --products MATLAB Parallel_Computing_Toolbox Mapping_Toolbox && \\\n    rm -f mpm /tmp/mathworks_root.log && \\\n    ln -s /opt/matlab/bin/matlab /usr/local/bin/matlab\n\n# Add \"matlab\" user and grant sudo permission.\nRUN adduser --shell /bin/bash --disabled-password --gecos \"\" matlab && \\\n    echo \"matlab ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/matlab && \\\n    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/matlab\n\n# Set user and work directory\nUSER matlab\nWORKDIR /home/matlab\nCMD [\"bash\"]\n\n\n\n\nTo build a Docker image with the name matlab-gitlab and the version reference r2021b, run the following command in the folder containing the Dockerfile:\nsudo docker build . -t matlab-gitlab:r2021b\nYou can verify the presence of the image with\nsudo docker images\nThis image is now available locally on the VPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also upload your Docker image to Dockerhub and have it available from there. This removes the need to build the image on the VPS as it can be pulled directly from DockerHub.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Register the MATLAB runner\nAfter deploying the gitlab-runner in step 2, we need to register a new runner for our matlab-gitlab image. Run the following command to register your runner and configure it to deploy in a Docker container on your server.\ndocker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register\nIn response to this command you will be prompted to answer a series of questions. You can find the required gitlab-ci token in your Gitlab repository under Settings -&gt; CI/CD -&gt; Runners:\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register \\\n  --non-interactive \\\n  --url \"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/\" \\\n  --registration-token \"REPOSITORY_TOKEN\" \\\n  --executor \"docker\" \\\n  --docker-image matlab-gitlab:r2021b \\\n  --description \"matlab-runner\" \\\n  --tag-list \"matlab\" \\\n  --docker-privileged=true \\\n  --docker-cap-add \"NET_ADMIN\" \\\n  --docker-pull-policy \"if-not-present\" \\\nFor the changes to take effect, restart the gitlab-runner with\nsudo docker restart gitlab-runner\nThe runner configurations are stored in /srv/gitlab-runner/config/config.toml. If you would like to view or or modify the MATLAB runner, run\nsudo nano /srv/gitlab-runner/config/config.toml\nAfter registering the runner, the configuration file should contain:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nconcurrent = 4\ncheck_interval = 0\n\n[session_server]\n  session_timeout = 1800\n\n[[runners]]\n  name = \"matlab-gitlab\"\n  url = \"https://gitlab.tudelft.nl\"\n  token = \"&lt;token&gt;\"\n  executor = \"docker\"\n  [runners.custom_build_dir]\n  [runners.cache]\n    [runners.cache.s3]\n    [runners.cache.gcs]\n    [runners.cache.azure]\n  [runners.docker]\n    tls_verify = false\n    image = \"matlab-gitlab:r2021b\"\n    privileged = true\n    disable_entrypoint_overwrite = false\n    cap_add = [\"NET_ADMIN\"]\n    oom_kill_disable = false\n    disable_cache = false\n    volumes = [\"/cache\"]\n    pull_policy = \"if-not-present\"\n    shm_size = 0\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Obtain a MATLAB license file\nEvery TU Delft employee has access to an Individual MATLAB license. Normally, you would activate MATLAB only once after installation through an online activation step. However, this does not work for a Docker container as it is relaunched for each CI trigger.\nThe following steps for activating MATLAB on an offline machine are adapted from the MATLAB Forum:\n\nObtain your Host ID\nObtain your computer login name or username\nActivate the license through the License Center to obtain license file\n\n1. Obtain your Host ID\nThe MATLAB license can only be activated for a specifc computer. In the Docker container, we will set the hostID of the container to 0242ac11ffff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDocker automatically assigns an IP address to each running container, starting from 172.17.0.2 until 172.17.0.255. These IP addresses determine the container’s MAC address (see here for more details), which in turn needs to match with our license. To prevent the MAC address of the MATLAB container from switching and thereby invalidating the license, we will set it to 02:42:ac:11:ff:ff in the .gitlab-ci.yml file.\n\n\n2. Obtain your computer login name or username\nThe MATLAB license is created for a specific user. In the Docker container, we will set the username to matlab.\n3. Activate the license through the License Center to obtain license file\n\nGo to the License Center: https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount\nUnder My Software, click the license number you want to activate. If you do not see your license number, in the bottom right hand corner, click View Additional Licenses or Trials.\nClick the Install and Activate tab\nClick Activate to Retrieve License File and/or Activate a Computer\nEnter the following information:\n\nthe release you are activating = r2021b (same version as in the Dockerfile)\nthe operating system = Linux\nthe host ID = 0242ac11ffff\nyour user or login name = matlab\nthe Activation Label = matlab-gitlab\n\n\nDownload the license.lic file\n\n\n\nStep 6. Configure the CI/CD pipeline on Gitlab\nBefore we can run a CI job, we need to configure a few settings in our Gitlab repository\n1. Add tag to MATLAB runner\nUnder Settings -&gt; CI/CD -&gt; Runners we can find the available specific runners. Press the edit button on the matlab-gitlab runner and add the tag matlab-gitlab. With this, we can call more easily call this specific runner within our CI pipeline.\n2. Add license as Variable\nUnder Settings -&gt; CI/CD -&gt; Variables add a new variable called MATLAB_LICENSE, past the content of the downloaded license.lic file and set type to file. Having the license available as a Gitlab variable allows us to update it without having to change the MATLAB image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could have added the license file directly to the Docker image. With the license file in the same folder as the Dockerfile and adding the following command to the Dockerfile, we can build a Docker image with an activated MATLAB:\nCOPY license.lic /opt/matlab/licenses/\nHere, we opted to have it accessible through the Gitlab settings together with the accompanying hostid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNever share any Docker images that contain license files or other confidential information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Add a job to test the pipeline\nTo test the pipeline, add the following content to .gitlab-ci.yml via CI/CD -&gt; Editor in your repository.\nvariables:\n  MAC_ADDRESS: 02:42:ac:11:ff:ff\n\ncheck_matlab:\n  tags: \n    - matlab-gitlab\n  before_script:\n    # Change the mac-address to match the MATLAB license\n    - sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether \"$MAC_ADDRESS\"\n\n    # Add the Matlab license to the Matlab installation in the container\n    - sudo mkdir /opt/matlab/licenses\n    - sudo mv ${MATLAB_LICENSE} /opt/matlab/licenses/license.lic   \n  script:    \n    # Run a MATLAB function/script through the -batch argument\n    - matlab -batch \"disp('hello world!')\"\nAfter commiting, the pipeline should run and execute the job check_matlab. You can check the status of the pipeline via CI/CD -&gt; Pipelines.\nIf all went well, you have successfully setup a Gitlab runner to run MATLAB code. Congrats!\n\n\nStep 8. Optional: Updating the MATLAB version\nIf you need to update the MATLAB version of the Docker container, you will need to go throught the following steps:\n\nUpdate the MATLAB version in the Dockerfile\nBuild the docker image with sudo docker build . -t matlab-gitlab:&lt;version&gt;\nDownload a new license.lic file (see step 5 of this guide)\nUpdate the CI Variable MATLAB_LICENSE with the new license content\nUpdate the image names (not the tags) in .gitlab-ci.yml to use the new image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to test your code with multiple MATLAB versions to ensure backward compatibility, please look at this example to use multiple docker images.",

    "text": "TU Delft offers its employees the use of physical or virtual servers. These servers are known as Faculty Managed Servers and can be requested to conduct work related to a specific project within a Faculty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to use the servers to set up services that are already provided by the ICT department.\n\n\nVirtual vs Physical Servers\nThere is a choice between virtual and physical servers. Virtual servers are provided free of charge and can be requested via TOPdesk. Physical servers can be requested by contacting the Faculty’s IT Manager and any associated costs are paid by the purchasing department.\nIn most cases, a virtual server is the most suitable option. However, a physical server may be necessary when it is intended for use as a GPU or computing cluster.\nServer Configuration\nWhen requesting a virtual server, users can choose from a range of predefined hardware and operating system configurations. The following operating systems are available: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (latest supported version), and Ubuntu (latest LTS version).\nIf additional capacity is needed, it can be requested via the ‘ICT malfunction’ or ‘request ICT service’ forms in TOPdesk. This includes options such as increasing the number of processors, cores per processor, RAM, or disk storage.\nSome considerations:\n\nICT provides the server, operating system, and network access.\nUsers are granted administrator privileges, allowing them to install any required software, provided it complies with the conditions specified in the request form.\nAccess can be granted to both TU Delft members and external users.\nICT provides daily backups, restoration services, and virus scanning for Windows servers.\nICT ensures that the server operating system remains up to date (e.g. security patches), except for Linux systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDetailed information on managing the server, including network and firewall settings, is provided at the bottom of the TOPdesk application form.\n\n\nExample Use Cases\n\nPerforming computational or data processing tasks that require a dedicated server environment.\nRunning an instance of a service or application, such as ABAQUS, COMSOL or other specialized tools for a lab or research group.\nHosting a static website, a web application, or an API for a project.\nHosting databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB or other database management systems.\nDeploying and managing TU Delft GitLab runners for CI/CD pipelines.\n\nRelevant links\n\nIntranet page for faculty managed servers\nTOPdesk form to request a new virtual server\nIntranet page for Faculty IT Managers.",

    "text": "Example - Long parameter list\nHere’s an example of a function that takes many parameters:\ndef process_machine_operation(machine_id, temperature, pressure, speed, duration):\n    # Perform machine operation\n    print(\"Machine ID:\", machine_id)\n    print(\"Temperature:\", temperature)\n    print(\"Pressure:\", pressure)\n    print(\"Speed:\", speed)\n    print(\"Operation Duration:\", duration)\n\n# Usage\nprocess_machine_operation(\n    machine_id=\"M001\", \n    temperature=100.5, \n    pressure=200.0, \n    speed=1500.0, \n    duration=5.0)\nThis function takes a lot of information at once: the machine ID, temperature, pressure, speed, and duration. If the function grows even more complex, it will become very hard to keep track of what each parameter means, and it could make the code difficult to maintain.\n\nSolutions\nTo solve this problem, we can do one or both of the following:\n\nSimplify the Function: Break the function into smaller parts that do one thing each.\nUse Objects to Group Related Data: Instead of passing many individual pieces of information, we can group them together into one object or structure that holds related information.\n\n\n1. Using a Dataclass\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n# Create a dataclass to group the machine operation parameters\n@dataclass\nclass MachineOperationData:\n    machine_id: str\n    temperature: float\n    pressure: float\n    speed: float\n    duration: float\nNow, instead of passing five separate parameters to our function, we’ll just pass one object that holds everything. Next, we change our process_machine_operation function to accept this new object, making it simpler and cleaner.\ndef process_machine_operation(operation_data):\n    # Perform machine operation\n    print(\"Machine ID:\", operation_data.machine_id)\n    print(\"Temperature:\", operation_data.temperature)\n    print(\"Pressure:\", operation_data.pressure)\n    print(\"Speed:\", operation_data.speed)\n    print(\"Operation Duration:\", operation_data.duration)\n\n# Usage \noperation_data = MachineOperationData(\n    machine_id=\"M001\", \n    temperature=100.5, \n    pressure=200.0, \n    speed=1500.0, \n    duration=5.0)\nprocess_machine_operation(operation_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can combine dataclasses with data validation through Pydantic.\n\n\n\n\n2. Divide and conquer\nAlthough using a single dataclass is a good start, we don’t want our data structure to become too big and complicated. If the dataclass starts holding too much data, it can make the code harder to understand. Instead, we can break it into smaller, simpler data classes that work together. For example:\n@dataclass\nclass Machine:\n    machine_id: str\n    manufacturer: str\n\n@dataclass\nclass OperationParameters:\n    temperature: float\n    pressure: float\n    speed: float\n    duration: float\n\n@dataclass\nclass EnvironmentalConditions:\n    humidity: float\n    altitude: float\n\n@dataclass\nclass MachineOperationData:\n    machine: Machine\n    operation_parameters: OperationParameters\n    environmental_conditions: EnvironmentalConditions\n\ndef process_machine_operation(operation_data):\n    print(\"Machine ID:\", operation_data.machine.machine_id)\n    \n    # Implement machine operation\nHere, instead of having one large MachineOperationData dataclass, we’ve divided it into smaller pieces. Each class now represents a specific part of the data, which can then be used individually as smaller classes or grouped together as needed. This approach keeps everything organized and easy to work with.",

They can be used to create an environment from scratch, or to update an existing environment.\n# Export an environment to a file\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml\n\n# Create an environment from a file\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n\n# Update an environment from a file\nconda env update -f environment.yml\n\n\n\nVirtual Environments (venv/virtualenv)\nPython provides venv as a buil-in tool for creating virtual environments. virtualenv is a third-party tool that provides similar functionality.\n\nBasic commands\n# Creating a virtual environment\n# Using venv (Python 3.3+ built-in)\npython -m venv your-env-name\n\n# Using virtualenv (must be installed first)\npip install virtualenv\nvirtualenv your-env-name\n\n#Activating the environment\n# Linux/macOS\nsource your-env-name/bin/activate\n# Windows\nyour-env-name\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Installing a library (package)\npip install lib_name\n\n# Uninstalling a library (package)\npip uninstall lib_name\n\n# To deactivate\ndeactivate\n\n\nManaging dependencies with pip\nA requirements.txt file lists all dependencies with their specific versions.\n# Export requirements.txt from an activated environment\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n\n# Install dependencies from requirements.txt\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tip\n\n\n\nUse pip-chill or pipreqs instead of pip freeze to exclude unnecessary dependencies. pip-chill lists only packages you installed, while pipreqs lists packages your code actually uses.\n\n\n\n\n\nDependency Management Tools\nConsider using tools that offer more sophisticated dependency management by integrating virtual environment creation and dependency resolution. They maintain a project manifest (e.g., pyproject.toml for Poetry) that specifies primary dependencies and generate lock files to pin exact versions for reproducibility.\n\nPipenv: Combines pip and virtualenv into a single tool, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.\nPoetry: Manages dependencies, environments, and package building in a streamlined way.\nPixi: A new tool that aims to provide a more user-friendly experience for managing Python environments and dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nCodeRefinery - Recording dependencies\nThe Turing Way - Package Management Systems\nConda documentation\nvirtualenv documentation\nvirtualenvwrapper extension",

Some additional tips:\n\nParticular metadata files are often capitalized, such as README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CHANGELOG, CITATION.cff, NOTICE, and MANIFEST.\nGenerally, all content that is generated upon building or running your code should be added to .gitignore. This likely includes the content of processed_data and results folder.\nGit cannot track empty folders. If you want to add empty folders to enforce a folder structure, e.g., processed_data orresults, the convention is to add the file .gitkeep to the folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing data\n\n\n\nIf your raw data files or any data assets are large (typically more than a few megabytes), it’s usually best not to include them directly in the repository. Instead:\n\nKeep such files externally (e.g. cloud storage, Git LFS), and add only a reference or a small sample to the repository.\nAdding placeholder files or instructions in the README for how to obtain the complete datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nCode Refinery - Organizing your projects\nArjanCodes guide to structuring Python projects\nA collection of .gitignore templates\nGit LFS",

A NAMESPACE file is typical for CRAN submissions.\n\n\n\n\nInstall with install.packages(\"roxygen2\").\nEnsure you are in the correct project directory and it has the standard R package structure.\nWriting documentation: Documentation is written as comments starting with #' directly above your function definitions. roxygen2 processes this and stores .Rd files in the man/ directory.

    "text": "Sphinx\nSphinx is a versatile documentation tool that is well-suited for documenting Python projects due to its easy integration with Python’s docstrings. Its capabilities extend beyond Python, making it a great solution for creating comprehensive documentation for projects in various programming languages (e.g. MATLAB).\nSome key features of Sphinx include:\n\nCross-referencing code and documentation across files.\nAutomatic generation of documentation from docstrings.\nSyntax highlighting for code examples.\nSupport for extensions and custom themes.\nMultiple output formats.\n\n\nGetting started with Sphinx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tip\n\n\n\nTo get started with Sphinx, we recommend the Coderefinery lesson on Sphinx and Markdown\n\n\n\nInstall dependency: You can install Sphinx in various ways, either through apt-get for Linux, Homebrew for macOS, or through Chocolatey for Windows. Assuming you have Python on your machine you can install it through conda or pip.\nSetup documentation: Create a directory for your documentation (/docs), and run sphinx-quickstart in that directory. The default answers to the questions are fine.\nConfigure Sphinx: Once you have the conf.py and index.rst files, you will need to modify them further. The index.rst file acts as the front page of your documentation and the root of the table of contents. The conf.py file is the main configuration file for the Sphinx documentation. It holds all your extensions and controls various aspects of the build process that can be customized to suit your needs. For example, sphinx.ext.autodoc is used for pulling documentation from docstrings, and sphinx.ext.mathjax for displaying mathematical content.\n\nBuilt-in extensions\nThird-party extensions\n\nWrite content: Add content to your documentation. In addition to reStructureText, Sphinx also integrates with markdown documentation through the MyST parser.\nBuild documentation: Once you have added the documentation files, you can build the documentation from the folder /docs with sphinx-build . _build/ or make html.\nFurther customization: You can customize the look of your documentation by changing themes in the conf.py file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sphinx configuration template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconfig.py\n\n\n\n\n\n# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder\n# This file only contains a selection of the most common options.

For example, this is required for hosting platforms like Read the Docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n# Core\nsphinx\n\n# Sphinx extensions\nsphinxcontrib-matlabdomain # Only for matlab source code\nsphinx-tabs\nsphinx-copybutton\n\n# MyST parser\nmyst-parser\nlinkify-it-py\n\n# Themes\npydata-sphinx-theme\nsphinx-book-theme\nsphinx-rtd-theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example repositories using Sphinx for Python:\n\n\n\n\nPython’s official documentation is created using Sphinx\nRead The Docs - the platform for hosting documentation is itself documented using Sphinx.\nNumPy\n\n\n\n\n\nSphinx autodoc\nOnce the Sphinx config.py is set up, you can generate the API reference documentation by using the sphinx-autodoc extension. By creating .rst files with the autodoc syntax, Sphinx will build the API reference.\n\n\nSphinx-matlabdomain\nFor documenting MATLAB projects, Sphinx can be extended for MATLAB. The sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain extension allows Sphinx to interpret and render MATLAB specific documentation. The extension can be installed through pip install sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain and add the extension to the conf.py file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example repositories using sphinx for MATLAB:\n\n\n\n\nENIGMA Toolbox - provides documentation in both Python and MATLAB, generated by Sphinx and hosted using Read the Docs.\nCobra Toolbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nCoderefinery lesson on Sphinx and Markdown\nGetting started with Sphinx",

It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, enabling the inclusion of executable code, interactive visualizations, equations, and rich formatting directly within the documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⮕ All of these guides are created with Quarto!\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\nDownloading: You can download the installer for your operating system from the Quarto website.\nRunning Quarto: You can run Quarto either from your command line or from VS Code, JupyterLab, RStudio, or any text editor. For VS Code you will need to install a Quarto extension. It is a stand-alone application and does not require Python.\nMarkdown flavour: Quarto projects use .qmd files which are a Markdown flavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Basic structure of a Quarto file\n\n\n\n\n\n    ---\n    title: \"Your Document Title\"\n    format: html # Or pdf, word, etc.\n    ---\n\n    # Introduction\n\n    Some text...\n\n    ## Section 1\n\n    Some text...\n\n    ```python\n    # This is a code block\n    import pandas as pd\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n    print(data.head())\n    ```\n\n    ## Section 2\n\n    Some more text....\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding content: Write your text using standard Markdown syntax and add code blocks.\nBuilding documentation:\n\nTo compile a Quarto document, use quarto render your-file-name.qmd. This command converts your .qmd file into the output format specified in the file’s header (e.g., HTML, PDF).\nYou can watch a file or directory for changes and automatically re-render with quarto preview your-file-name.qmd, which is useful to see live updates.\n\nAdditional features:\n\nQuarto supports cross-referencing figures, tables, and other elements within your document. You can also use BibTeX for citations.\nYou can have interactive components for web outputs (e.g. embeded Plotly charts).\nExtensive options for custom styles and layouts.\n\nPublishing: Quarto documents are portable and can be shared as is, allowing others to compile them on their own systems or published by hosting the output files on a server like GitHub Pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples\n\n\n\n\nQuarto gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PDF engine\n\n\n\nIn order to create PDFs you will need to install a LaTeX engine if you do not have one installed already.

    "text": "Writing tests\nMATLAB supports script-based, function-based, and class-based unit tests, allowing for a range of testing strategies from simple to advanced use cases. See the MATLAB documentation for more information:\n\nMatlab - Ways to write unit tests\n\nScript-based testing\nFunction-based testing\nClass-based testing\n\n\n\nConvention for writing tests\n\nIt is recommened place tests in a separate folder, typically named tests/.\nPrefix test files with “test” followed by the file that is tested. For example, a test for the file DrawRandomNumber.m should be called TestDrawRandomNumber.m. Matlab will recognize any scripts that are prefixed or suffixed with the string “test” as tests.\n\n\n\nClass-based unit tests\nBecause of the limited features of the script- and function-based testing, this guide will discuss class-based testing. Class-based tests give you access to shared test fixtures, test parameterization, and grouping tests into categories. Check out our additional testing concepts for more information about these concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Introduction to class-based testing\n\n\n\nCheck out this short MATLAB video on writing class-based tests.\n\n\nYou can find an example below with the matlab syntax for writing Class-based unit tests:\nclassdef TestSumNumbers &lt; matlab.unittest.TestCase\n    methods (Test)\n        function testSumNumbers(testCase)\n            result = sumNumbers(2, 3);            \n            testCase.verifyEqual(result, 5)\n        end\n    end\nend\n Check out the MATLAB documentation for an introductory example: Write Simple Test Case Using Classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotated class-based unit test example\n\n\n\n\n\n% Test classes are created by inheriting (&lt; symbol) the  Matlab Testing \n% framework.\n%\n% e.g. classdef nameOfTest &lt; matlab.unittest.TestCase\n%      end\n\nclassdef (TestTags = {'Unit'}) test_example &lt; matlab.unittest.TestCase \n%                              It's convention to name the test file \n%                              test_\"filename being tested\".m\n%\n%         TestTags are an optional feature that are useful for identifying \n%         what kind of test you're coding, as you might only want to run \n%         certain tests that are related.\n\n    properties \n        % Class properties are not required, but are useful to contain \n        % common parameters between tests.\n    end\n    \n    methods (TestClassSetup) \n        % TestClassSetup methods are not required, but are usually used to\n        % setup common testing variables, or loading data. These methods\n        % are executed *prior to* the (Test) methods.\n    end\n    \n    methods (TestClassTeardown) \n        % TestClassTeardown methods are not required, but are useful to\n        % delete any files created during the test execution. These methods\n        % are executed *after* the (Test) methods.\n    end\n    \n    methods (Test) % Each test is it's own method function, and takes \n                   % testCase as their only argument.\n\n        function test_sumNumbers_returns_expected_value_for_integer_case(testCase) \n        % Use very descriptive test method names - this helps for debugging\n        % when error occurs.\n                        \n            % Call the function you'd like to test, e.g:\n%             actualValue = sumNumbers(2,2); % Test example integer case, 2+2\n            % Since the function sumNumbers is not defined, the test will\n            % fail.

    "text": "In writing tests for research software, we often differentiate between four types of tests: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. In addition, regression tests are used to ensure that recent code changes haven’t adversely affected existing features or functionality.\n\n\n\nTesting pyramid © 2023 SketchingDev\n\n\n\nUnit tests\nA unit test is a type of test where individual units or components of the software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. A unit can be a function, method, or class. The main purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.\n\n\nIntegration tests\nIntegration testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose is to verify that the units work together as expected and that the interfaces between them function correctly. Integration tests aims to expose defects in the interactions between integrated components.\n\n\nEnd-to-end tests\nEnd-to-end testing is focused on checking the entire system from start to finish, simulating real use cases. The goal is to verify the software functions as a whole from the user’s perspective.\n\n\nRegression tests\nRegression testing aims to verify that recent code changes haven’t adversely affected existing features or functionality. It involves re-running previously executed test cases to ensure that the software still behaves as expected after modifications. The primary purpose of regression testing is to catch unintended side effects of code changes and ensure that new features or bug fixes haven’t introduced regressions or broken existing functionality elsewhere in the code. Regression tests can include both unit tests and integration tests, as well as higher-level tests.\n\n\nDesigning a test case\nFor more complex integration, regression, or end-to-end tests, it can be useful to first describe the test case in words.\n\nDescription: Description of test case\nPreconditions: Conditions that need to be met before executing the test case\nTest Steps: To execute test cases, you need to perform some actions. Mention all the test steps in detail and the order of execution\nTest Data: If required, list data that needed to execute the test cases\nExpected Result: The result we expect once the test cases are executed\nPostcondition: Conditions that need to be achieved when the test case was successfully executed",

Developers create so-called feature branches off of the main branch, work on their changes, and then merge them back into the main branch via pull requests. The process is built around the principle of continuous collaboration and is particularly useful for projects where regular updates and deployments are common.\nGitflow relies on two primary branches - main and develop. Developers create feature branches off of the develop branch. Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into the develop branch, which itself is merged with main for each new release of the software. It can be a better choice for managing larger projects with distinct release cycles and versioning requirements (e.g., tools tied to publications) or requiring parallel development of features and experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn more\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Flow getting started\nIntroduction GitHub Flow",

It’s important to note that while the terms main and master refer to the default branch in a repository, they are functionally the same.
