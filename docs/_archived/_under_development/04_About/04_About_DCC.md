# Getting support
Our purpose is helping researchers to develop skills in the application of FAIR principles to their research activities and reach their data management and software development goals.

**We have expertise in data management, research software and research computing**

## Example of things we can do
- Custom software development or modification
- Scaling up to larger computing systems, code optimization, workflow automation
- Preparing a code for release, or cleaning up old code that needs to be re-used
- Transforming a code from an individual project to a collaborative project (or group training on this topic)
- Data services (optimizing I/O, data versioning, databases, data sharing, and opening)
- Improving research workflows with contemporary software tools.
- We do consultation and training to make your research workflow more FAIR data and software wise.

## How  we work and support our community
> The more context we get from you the better we can help you. Our goal is to empower you with best practices and collaborate with you.

- We provide materials like these guides to address basic questions
