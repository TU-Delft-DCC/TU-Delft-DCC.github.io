## Purpose and benefits
The DCC Guides will be a curated, well-maintained online resource tailored for research support staff and researchers at TU Delft. They will provide expert guidance on data management, research software development, and computing practices. By incorporating best practices from both internal and external sources, the guides will offer a centralized, comprehensive collection of solutions and resources specific to the TU Delft research environment.

The DCC Guides will support **research support staff** by:

- Enabling the collection, curation, and sharing of developed solutions and relevant resources.
- Promoting a consistent, unified approach to delivering research support.

The DCC Guides will support **researchers** by:

- Helping them understand the key challenges and requirements of digital research.
- Facilitating compliance with TU Delft policies on data management and research software.
- Providing standalone documentation for resolving digital research challenges independently.

## Audience
The DCC Guides are primarily designed for the DCC and TU Delft research support staff, with researchers as a secondary audience. Usability for support processes is a core focus. Success will be assessed through increased user engagement (measured by feedback and site analytics) and improved support outcomes (evaluated internally).

#### 1. DCC team members
As the main contributors and maintainers, the DCC team is the primary audience. A key goal is to document and preserve developed solutions for reuse, avoiding redundant effort. The team will be responsible for regularly updating the guides, integrating user feedback, and ensuring content quality.

#### 2. TU Delft research support staff
This group includes Faculty Data Stewards, ICT Innovation, and the Library’s Research and Data Services team. These staff members will use the guides as a trusted resource to support researchers more effectively and stay up to date with best practices.

#### 3. TU Delft researchers
Researchers will benefit from easy access to current, reliable information to support their research workflows. The guides are not intended as a complete training pathway and will link to trustworthy external resources where appropriate.
