### What is Research Software Engineering?

Research Software Engineering (RSE) refers to the practices and roles that ensure research software is:
- correct and reliable,
- reusable and maintainable,
- documented and reproducible,
- FAIR and openly shareable where possible.

RSE work is not limited to people with “RSE” in their job title; many support roles perform RSE tasks as part of their work.

### How success is measured

Across support roles, success often looks like:
- reduced friction in research workflows,
- fewer recurring technical issues,
- easier onboarding for new contributors,
- improved reproducibility and transparency.
