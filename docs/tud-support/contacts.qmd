TU Delft research support is **distributed**, and knowing *where to ask what* is a core skill.

This page helps you route questions efficiently.

### Peer support (first stop)
For: sense-checking, best practices, informal advice.

- Colleagues in your faculty or department
- Cross-faculty RSE / data steward / support networks
- Internal community channels

### Library research support

- FAIR and Open Science guidance
- Training and workshops
- Data management planning connections

### ICT department

- compute, storage, networking
- access issues and platforms
- CI, deployment, and tooling environments

### Faculty-level support

- domain-specific workflows
- local policies and practices
- coordination with research groups

## When to involve the DCC?

- a question spans multiple support domains,
- existing guidance is missing or unclear,
- solutions should be shared TU Delft–wide.

## Communication norms

- Ask questions in shared channels where possible
- Document decisions and patterns for reuse
- Escalate early when dependencies cross support units
