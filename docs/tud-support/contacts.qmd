TU Delft research support is **distributed**, and knowing *where to ask what* is a core skill.

The DIgital Competence Centre (DCC) collaborates with many partners, both within TU Delft and externally. This document provides an overview of the organizations and initiatives DCC works with regularly. It is intended for TU Delft research support staff and other interested colleagues.

## TU Delft Partners

### Researchers
TU Delft is a technical university with eight faculties and the QuTech Research Institute. The DCC is a central (virtual) team that provides research support across all faculties. QuTech is an independent research institute with its own software development team.

- About TU Delft: [https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft)

### ICT
All research software engineers (RSEs) working in the DCC are employed by ICT-Innovation.

### ICT-Innovation
The innovation department hosts a diverse group of experts and takes on projects that do not fit within more traditional ICT departments. The department meets regularly to coordinate activities and share expertise.

### Cloud for Research
Cloud for Research (Cloud4Research) supports researchers in using cloud services for research purposes and serves as a central contact point for cloud-related questions.

- Cloud4Research: [https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/](https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/)

### Library 
All data mangers working in DCC are employed by TU Delft Library-Research Data and Software.

The Library regularly hosts public events such as trainings and meetups. Rooms can be requested for meetings open to the TU Delft community.

### Research Data and Software
Research Data and Software (RDS) focuses on research data management, training, and policy development. The team works closely with other research support units at TU Delft, including the 4TU.ResearchData repository.

## When to involve the DCC?

- a question spans multiple support domains,
- existing guidance is missing or unclear,
- solutions should be shared TU Delft–wide.

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="true"}
## Communication norms

- Ask questions in shared channels where possible
- Document decisions and patterns for reuse
- Escalate early when dependencies cross support units
