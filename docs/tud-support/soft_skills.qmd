Research support is fundamentally **working with people**.

Whether you are supporting software, data, infrastructure, or policy, your effectiveness depends on how well you:
- understand people’s needs,
- communicate constraints and trade-offs,
- coordinate across organizational boundaries,
- and create trust over time.

Soft skills are what really make good practices scale and stick.
:::


### Communication as translation

A core soft skill in research support is **translation**:
- between researchers and technical systems,
- between different support roles,
- between short-term needs and long-term sustainability.

Good communication often looks like:
- asking clarifying questions early,
- summarizing decisions in writing,
- naming assumptions explicitly.

#### Useful questions to ask

- *“What problem are we trying to solve?”*
- *“Who will use this, and when?”*
- *“What would success look like in three months?”*
- *“What happens if we do nothing?”*

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
If a request feels vague, it probably is. Clarifying scope is support work, not a delay.
:::


### Managing expectations and scope

Many support challenges arise from **implicit expectations**.

As a support professional, it is often necessary to:
- make trade-offs explicit,
- limit scope to what is feasible,
- push back on unrealistic timelines.

#### Language that helps

- *“I can help with X now; Y would need to come later.”*
- *“We can do this quickly, or we can make it sustainable: which matters more here?”*
- *“Who will maintain this after the project ends?”*

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
Saying “no” is part of responsible support especially when it protects sustainability and maintainability.
:::

### Collaboration across roles and units

Research support at TU Delft is **distributed by design**.  
No single role covers everything.

Effective collaboration means:
- knowing what other roles do,
- recognizing when to involve others,
- avoiding ownership gaps.

#### Good coordination practices

- Involve other support roles early when work overlaps
- Be explicit about responsibilities and handovers
- Document decisions so others can follow later

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Good coordination reduces duplicated effort.
:::


### Teaching 

Support work is not just about solving today’s problem, it is about **reducing future support load**.

Teaching can be informal and lightweight:
- pairing once instead of fixing silently,
- explaining the *why*, not just the *how*,
- leaving behind documentation or templates.

#### Small enablement moves that scale

- Write down the steps you just explained verbally
- Turn a repeated question into a short guide section
- Share a reusable example instead of a one-off fix

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
If you solve the same problem twice, it is time to document it.
:::


### Navigating ambiguity

Support work often involves:
- incomplete information,
- shifting priorities,
- unclear ownership.

This is perfectly normal and we should learn to be comfortable with it. To enable that, helpful habits include:
- making uncertainty explicit,
- proposing a next small step,
- revisiting decisions as context changes.


### Professional boundaries and sustainability

Finally, sustainable support requires **boundaries**.

This includes:
- protecting time for documentation and learning,
- avoiding overcommitment,
- recognizing when work should stop or change direction.

#### Signals to watch for

- repeated “quick fixes” with no lasting improvement
- undocumented decisions that keep resurfacing
- work that depends entirely on one person

### In summary

Soft skills in research support are about:

- clarity over cleverness,
- sustainability over speed,
- coordination over heroics.

They are learned through practice, reflection; they take time.
