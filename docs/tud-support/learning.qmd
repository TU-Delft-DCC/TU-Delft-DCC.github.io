## Learning foundations for research support staff

Research support roles at TU Delft span software, data, infrastructure, policy, and coordination.  
While depth differs per role, many **learning foundations are shared** across support functions.

This section provides a common orientation to learning and development. It can be used for:

- onboarding and self-orientation,
- identifying learning priorities,
- conversations about professional growth.
- finding structured training & courses to follow.

## Core technical foundations

Most research support staff benefit from familiarity with the following areas, regardless of their primary role.

#### Version control and collaboration
- Understanding Git-based workflows
- Working with issues, pull requests, and reviews
- Using version control as shared documentation

#### Reproducibility concepts
- Managing dependencies and environments
- Documenting workflows and assumptions
- Understanding the difference between repeatability and reproducibility

#### Programming and scripting awareness
- Reading and modifying code when needed
- Understanding commonly used research languages
- Knowing when custom code is appropriate and when it is not

#### Documentation practices
- Writing clear onboarding instructions
- Capturing decisions and rationale
- Creating reusable templates and examples

#### FAIR principles
- Applying FAIR to data and software
- Understanding metadata, licensing, and citation
- Knowing relevant archiving and publishing platforms

## Role-specific expertise

Different research support roles naturally go deeper in different areas.  
This diversity is a strength and enables effective collaboration.

**Research software–focused roles**

- Software design and architecture
- Testing and continuous integration
- Packaging, releases, and reuse
- Performance and scalability considerations

**Data-focused support roles**

- Data Management Plans
- Research data policies and compliance
- Metadata and documentation standards
- Data storage, archiving, and sharing

**Infrastructure and research IT roles**

- Compute and storage platforms
- Security and access management
- Reliability and monitoring
- Supporting reproducible environments

**Library and Open Science roles**

- Licensing and copyright
- Open access and publishing workflows
- Training and community enablement
- Policy interpretation and guidance

## Structured training & course sources

In addition to self-directed learning, the following structured training opportunities are valuable for support staff across TU Delft:
