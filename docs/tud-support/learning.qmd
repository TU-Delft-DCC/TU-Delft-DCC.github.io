## Learning foundations for research support staff

Research support roles at TU Delft span software, data, infrastructure, policy, and coordination.  
While depth differs per role, many **learning foundations are shared** across support functions.

This section provides a common orientation to learning and development. It can be used for:

- onboarding and self-orientation,
- identifying learning priorities,
- conversations about professional growth.
- finding structured training & courses to follow.

## Core technical foundations

These are baseline technical skills expected across most research support roles (RSEs, RDEs, data stewards and related roles).

- Version control with Git
- Programming or scripting (e.g. Python, R, and/or C/C++)
- Linux and shell usage
- Working on shared research infrastructure
- Understanding of structured data and common data formats
- Basic testing and validation practices

#### Software oriented roles (e.g. RSEs)

- Software design and modularization
- Code maintainability and refactoring
- Automated testing and CI/CD

#### Data oriented roles (e.g. RDEs)

- Data modeling and schema design
- Metadata concepts and standards
- Data validation, quality check and ETL pipelines

## Structured training & course sources

In addition to self-directed learning, the following structured training opportunities are valuable for support staff across TU Delft:
