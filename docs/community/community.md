## eScience Center
Founded in 2012 as an independent foundation by NWO and SURF, [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) is the national centre with the digital skills to create innovative software solutions in academic research. They award research projects based on [calls for proposals](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/calls-for-proposals/), and [train researchers](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/digital-skills/) in the use of research software. They offer our expertise in the form of research software engineers (RSEs), the technology specialists with expert digital skills who work with us at the Center. 


## NL-RSE
[NL-RSE](https://nl-rse.org/) brings together the community of people writing and contributing to research software from Dutch universities, knowledge institutes, companies and other organizations to share knowledge, to organize meetings, and raise awareness for the scientific recognition of research software.
