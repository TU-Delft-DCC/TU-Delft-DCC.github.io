It's straightforward to cite research papers, but with software sometimes it's not as obvious. It is recommended to place a `CITATION.cff` file in the root of your repository to inform others about the preferred way to cite the software. GitHub can automatically parse the `.cff` file to create citation snippets in APA or BibTeX format. If you'd prefer the software to be cited through a journal publication, you can mention this in the README and in the `CITATION.cff` file.

### {{< fa lightbulb >}} An example of a `CITATION.cff`

```
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: "If you are using this software, please cite it as shown below."
authors:
- family-names: "Doe"
  given-names: "Jane"
  orcid: "https://orcid.org/9999-9999-9999-9999"
title: "Name of your software"
version: 1.0.1
doi: "11.1111/11111"
date-released: 2024-12-31
license: MIT
url: "https://github.com/your_repo"
```

When citing a paper that is linked to the software you can use `preferred-citation` argument.

### {{< fa lightbulb >}} How the citation would look on GitHub
On GitHub, it will show in either APA or BibTeX formatting, as they are the currently supported formats. If you add a `CITATION.cff` file to your repository, then a label for citing will automatically be generated and will show up on the right sidebar of the repository.

**APA**

> Doe, J. (2024). Name of your software (Version 1.0.1) [Computer software]. https://doi.org/11.1111/11111

**BibTeX**

> @software{Joe_Name_of_your_software_2024,
      author = {Doe, Jane},
      doi = {11.1111/11111},
      month = {12},
      title = {{Name of your software}},
      url = {https://github.com/your_repo},
      version = {1.0.1},
      year = {2024}
}

This is an example of software citation.
