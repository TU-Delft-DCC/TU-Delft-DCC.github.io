A code of conduct establishes expectations for behavior within your project's community, creating an inclusive space that minimizes conflicts and promotes constructive collaboration.

What to include:

- **Purpose:** State the reason for having a code of conduct and its importance for a positive community.
- **Expected behavior:** Clearly outline the standards of behavior expected from all participants.
- **Unacceptable behavior:** Specify actions and language that are not tolerated.
- **Enforcement:** Explain the consequences of violating the code of conduct and how incidents will be handled.
- **Contact information:** Provide contact details for reporting concerns or issues.

You can add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file at your repository's root level. GitHub will automatically detect and display it in your community profile.
