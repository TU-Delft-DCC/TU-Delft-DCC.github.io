There are various tools available that can help you create, manage, and deploy project documentation more effectively.

## Sphinx
Sphinx is a versatile documentation tool that is well-suited for documenting Python projects due to its easy integration with Python's docstrings. Its capabilities extend beyond Python, making it a great solution for creating comprehensive documentation for projects in various programming languages (e.g. MATLAB).

Some key features of Sphinx include:

- Cross-referencing code and documentation across files.
- Automatic generation of documentation from docstrings.
- Syntax highlighting for code examples.
- Support for extensions and custom themes.
- Multiple output formats.

### Getting started with Sphinx

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### {{< fa lightbulb >}} Tip
To get started with Sphinx, we recommend the [Coderefinery lesson on Sphinx and Markdown](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/sphinx/)
:::

1. **Install dependency:** You can [install Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) in various ways, either through `apt-get` for Linux, Homebrew for macOS, or through Chocolatey for Windows. Assuming you have Python on your machine you can install it through `conda` or `pip`.
1. **Setup documentation:** Create a directory for your documentation (`/docs`), and run `sphinx-quickstart` in that directory. The default answers to the questions are fine.
1. **Configure Sphinx:** Once you have the `conf.py` and `index.rst` files, you will need to modify them further. The `index.rst` file acts as the front page of your documentation and the root of the table of contents. The `conf.py` file is the main configuration file for the Sphinx documentation. It holds all your extensions and controls various aspects of the build process that can be customized to suit your needs. For example, `sphinx.ext.autodoc` is used for pulling documentation from docstrings, and `sphinx.ext.mathjax` for displaying mathematical content.
    - [Built-in extensions](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html)
    - [Third-party extensions](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/)
1. **Write content:** Add content to your documentation. In addition to reStructureText, Sphinx also integrates with markdown documentation through the [MyST parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
1. **Build documentation:** Once you have added the documentation files, you can build the documentation from the folder `/docs` with `sphinx-build . _build/` or `make html`.
1. **Further customization:** You can customize the look of your documentation by changing [themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) in the `conf.py` file.

{{< fa exclamaition >}} When using Sphinx extensions or custom themes beyond core functionality, a `requirements.txt` file is mandatory for reproducible documentation builds across environments. For example, this is required for hosting platforms like Read the Docs.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon=false appearance="simple"} 
## `requirements.txt`
```markdown
# Core
sphinx

# Sphinx extensions
sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain # Only for matlab source code
sphinx-tabs
sphinx-copybutton

# MyST parser
myst-parser
linkify-it-py

# Themes
pydata-sphinx-theme
sphinx-book-theme
sphinx-rtd-theme
```

### {{< fa lightbulb >}}  **Example repositories using Sphinx for Python:**

- [Python's official documentation is created using Sphinx](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Read The Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - the platform for hosting documentation is itself documented using Sphinx.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
:::

### Sphinx autodoc
Once the Sphinx `config.py` is set up, you can generate the API reference documentation by using the [sphinx-autodoc extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html). By creating `.rst` files with the autodoc syntax, Sphinx will build the API reference.

### Sphinx-matlabdomain
For documenting MATLAB projects, Sphinx can be extended for MATLAB. The [**sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain**](https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain/) extension allows Sphinx to interpret and render MATLAB specific documentation. The extension can be installed through `pip install sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain` and add the extension to the `conf.py` file. 

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### {{< fa lightbulb >}} **Example repositories using sphinx for MATLAB:**

## Jupyter Book
Jupyter Book uses Sphinx to convert notebooks and Markdown documents into an interactive publishing framework (with executable content). It integrates Jupyter Notebooks with Sphinx's documentation capabilities, enabling features like cell execution and output caching directly within the documentation. Jupyter Book is essentially a specialized wrapper around Sphinx and the MyST-NB extension, designed to make publishing content easier.

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
{{< fa info-circle >}} The [TU Delft OPEN Interactive Textbooks](https://textbooks.open.tudelft.nl/textbooks/catalog/category/interactive) platform uses Jupyter Book to create textbooks. 
:::

### Features
- Jupyter Book can integrate outputs by allowing code execution within the content, making it ideal for tutorials, courses, and technical documentation that require live examples.
- Jupyter Book uses Markdown for Jupyter (MyST) which extends the traditional Markdown syntax to include features normally available in reStructuredText (reST). **This makes it easier to include complex formatting and dynamic content directly in Markdown files.**
- Jupyter Book can execute notebook cells and cache outputs. This means that content including code outputs can be generated once and reused.

### Getting started
JupyterBook has extensive documentation on getting [started with building a book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/your-first-book.html#).

## MkDocs
MkDocs is a static site generator that uses markdown for all documentation, simplifying the writing process, and is configured with a single YAML file. It is lightweight compared to Sphinx but less feature-rich for complex use cases, and is best suitable for straightforward project documentation without heavy API generation needs.

### Getting started

1. You can install it through pip (`pip install mkdocs`). Then you can initialize your MkDocs project by running `mkdocs new your_project_name`.
2. Place your markdown documentation in your `docs` directory and define the structure in your `mkdocs.yml` file.
3. You can preview your site locally and see live updates as you make changes by running `mkdocs serve`.
4. When you want to publish your documentation run `mkdocs build`.
5. MkDocs is designed to be hosted on almost any static file server and works well with GitHub Pages.

## Quarto
Similar to Jupyter Book, Quarto is a publishing framework that allows you to create dynamic documents, presentations, reports, websites, and more. It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, enabling the inclusion of executable code, interactive visualizations, equations, and rich formatting directly within the documents.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
**⮕ All of these guides are created with Quarto!**
:::

### Getting started
1. **Downloading:** You can download the installer for your operating system from the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
2. **Running Quarto:** You can run Quarto either from your command line or from VS Code, JupyterLab, RStudio, or any text editor. For VS Code you will need to install a Quarto extension. It is a stand-alone application and does not require Python.
3. **Markdown flavour:** Quarto projects use `.qmd` files which are a Markdown flavour.

## {{< fa info-circle >}} Basic structure of a Quarto file
```
    ---
    title: "Your Document Title"
    format: html # Or pdf, word, etc.
    ---

    # Introduction

    Some text...

    ## Section 1

    Some text...

    ```python
    # This is a code block
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    print(data.head())
    ```

    ## Section 2

    Some more text....

```
:::
4. **Adding content:** Write your text using standard Markdown syntax and add [code blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#source-code).
5. **Building documentation:**
    - To compile a Quarto document, use `quarto render your-file-name.qmd`. This command converts your `.qmd` file into the output format specified in the file’s header (e.g., HTML, PDF).
    - You can watch a file or directory for changes and automatically re-render with `quarto preview your-file-name.qmd`, which is useful to see live updates.
6. **Additional features:**
    - Quarto supports cross-referencing figures, tables, and other elements within your document. You can also use BibTeX for citations.
    - You can have interactive components for web outputs (e.g. embeded Plotly charts).
    - Extensive options for custom styles and layouts.
7. **Publishing**: Quarto documents are portable and can be shared as is, allowing others to compile them on their own systems or published by hosting the output files on a server like GitHub Pages.

## Tools for R

R project documentation generally includes in-line comments and function documentation using `roxygen2`. Additionally, comprehensive examples and usage guides are often provided through vignettes, which are included within an R package itself.

To extend `roxygen2` documentation into a static website for your package you can use `pkgdown`. `pkgdown` automatically generates a website from your package's documentation and vignettes, similar to how Sphinx is used for Python projects.
