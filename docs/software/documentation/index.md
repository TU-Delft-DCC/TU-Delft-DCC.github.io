Documentation serves as a bridge between the developer and user, and effectively communicating and explaining the code is as important as the code itself. Often, two types of documentation are distinguished: User and developer documentation. Both are essential for the success of a software project, and they serve different purposes.

### User documentation
User documentation is aimed at those who will use the software, focusing on how to effectively utilize it. This documentation typically includes user manuals and tutorials, possibly FAQs and troubleshooting guides. The emphasis is on simplicity and accessibility, ensuring that anyone can understand how to use the software.


### Developer documentation
Developer documentation targets developers who need to understand the internal parts of the software for purposes of development, maintenance, or integration. It can include additional details such as Application Programming Interface (API) documentation and development guidelines. Developer documentation is more detailed providing insights necessary for modifying and enhancing the software.
