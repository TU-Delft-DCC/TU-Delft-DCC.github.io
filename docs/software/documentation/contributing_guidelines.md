A well-maintained `README` provides an overview of your project's current state, while a `CONTRIBUTING` guide encourages user/developer involvement. Together, these documents help maintain project clarity and make it easier to manage contributions.

## Setting up a CONTRIBUTING guide

There are no strict guidelines for a contributing guide and the content will depend on the project size, the number of collaborators, and your particular workflow. Consider including:

1. **Introduction**: Welcome the contributors and express appreciation for community contributions. 
2. **Add a [code of conduct](./code_of_conduct.md):** This helps to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment.
3. **How to contribute**: Explain precise contribution guidelines
   - **Issue tracking:** Explain how to report issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.).
   - **Pull requests:** Detail the process for submitting pull requests. This includes instructions on forking the repository, creating a branch, making changes, and the follow-up steps for a successful pull request.
   - **Code review process:** Describe how contributions will be reviewed and integrated.
4. **Community and communication**: List the channels through which contributors can communicate and set their expectations regarding the responsiveness and availability of project maintainers.
5. **Style guide and coding standards**: Providing a (separate) coding style guide or documenting coding standards would be best practice. This way contributors would ensure consistency across the codebase.
6. **Legal implications**: Inform contributors about the licensing under which their contributions will be used and any intellectual property considerations they should be aware of.
