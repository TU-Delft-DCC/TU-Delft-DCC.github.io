MATLAB does not use virtual environments like Python, where isolated environments manage dependencies. Instead, MATLAB handles project-specific dependencies using:

- **Toolboxes** - Pre-packaged libraries that must be licensed and available
- [**MATLAB projects**](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/projects.html) - A feature that manages paths and environments for a project
- **Path management** - Manually adding paths to the MATLAB search path with `addpath` and `rmpath`

To check dependencies in a project:

- Use [**`requiredfilesandproducts`**](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.codetools.requiredfilesandproducts.html) to identify required MathWorks toolboxes for a script of function.
- Use the the [**Dependency Analyzer**](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/analyze-project-dependencies.html) to detect file dependencies.


### Custom MATLAB Dependency Manager

To offer a solution for managing dependencies in MATLAB through a dependency file, we have created a Dependency Manager:
