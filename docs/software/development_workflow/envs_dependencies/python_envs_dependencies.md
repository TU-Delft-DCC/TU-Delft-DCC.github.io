When working with Python, managing dependencies and environments is important to ensure your project can be reproduced and shared. 

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## {{< fa info-circle >}} Definitions:
A **dependency** is any external library your project needs, and a **virtual environment** is an isolated workspace where dependencies are installed.
:::

There are several ways to manage dependencies and environments:

- [Conda environments](#conda-environments)
- [Virtual environments](#virtual-environments-venvvirtualenv) (`venv`/`virtualenv`)
- [Dependency management tools](#dependency-management-tools) (e.g. `poetry`, `pipenv`)


### Conda Environments

Conda is a package and environment manager popular in the research and data science community. It allows you to manage both Python and non-Python dependencies.

#### **Basic commands**
```bash
# Create a new environment, e.g. with python 3.12
conda create -n your_env_name python=3.12

# List all environments
conda env list

# Activate an environment
conda activate your_env_name

# Install packages in an environment
conda install package_name

# Remove a package
conda remove package_name

# Export an environment to a file
conda env export > environment.yml

# Deactivate an environment
conda deactivate

# Remove an environment
conda env remove -n your_env_name
```	

#### **Conda environment files**
Conda environment files (`environment.yml`) are used to specify the dependencies of a project. They can be used to create an environment from scratch, or to update an existing environment.

```bash
# Export an environment to a file
conda env export > environment.yml

# Create an environment from a file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Update an environment from a file
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

### Virtual Environments (`venv`/`virtualenv`)
Python provides `venv` as a buil-in tool for creating virtual environments. `virtualenv` is a third-party tool that provides similar functionality.

#### **Basic commands**

```bash
# Creating a virtual environment
# Using venv (Python 3.3+ built-in)
python -m venv your-env-name

# Using virtualenv (must be installed first)
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv your-env-name

#Activating the environment
# Linux/macOS
source your-env-name/bin/activate
# Windows
your-env-name\Scripts\activate

# Installing a library (package)
pip install lib_name

# Uninstalling a library (package)
pip uninstall lib_name

# To deactivate
deactivate

```

#### **Managing dependencies with `pip`**

A `requirements.txt` file lists all dependencies with their specific versions.

```bash
# Export requirements.txt from an activated environment
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Tip
Use [`pip-chill`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-chill/) or [`pipreqs`](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) instead of `pip freeze` to exclude unnecessary dependencies. `pip-chill` lists only packages you installed, while `pipreqs` lists packages your code actually uses.
:::


### Dependency Management Tools

Consider using tools that offer more sophisticated dependency management by integrating virtual environment creation and dependency resolution. They maintain a project manifest (e.g., `pyproject.toml` for Poetry) that specifies primary dependencies and generate lock files to pin exact versions for reproducibility.

- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/): Combines `pip` and `virtualenv` into a single tool, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/): Manages dependencies, environments, and package building in a streamlined way.
- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/tutorials/python/): A new tool that aims to provide a more user-friendly experience for managing Python environments and dependencies.
