In software development, the choices you make at the start will affect your project's final outcome. One key decision is how to structure your project, as a well-organised setup is essential for reproducibility and long-term maintainability.

### Essential principles
- **Consitant directory structure**: Have a consistent and meaningful directory naming convention.
- **Clear file and folder naming**: Opt for lowercase names combined with underscores or hyphens.
- **Managing access levels**: Use different Git repositories for public and private parts of your project. Use `.gitignore` or a specific non-tracked folder for sensitive content and/or files that are too large.
- **Clear documentation**: Include a `README` at the project's root to offer a summary, and add an appropriate `LICENSE` to define the terms for reuse and modification.
- **Coding standards**: Adhere to a consistent coding style to enhance code readability. Check out our [code style guide](/docs/software/code_quality/code_style.md) for more information.

### Other recommendations
- **Code reusability**: Store reusable software elements in a separate repository for efficiency across projects or consider packaging them.
- **Modular code design**: Aim for modular code design to improve maintainability and reusability.
- **Dependency management**: Use virtual environments to manage project dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across different setups.

## Repository structures

The following are recommendations of how you can structure your project repository for Python, MATLAB, and R projects.

### Python

├── src/                      # Contains your main code
│   └── your_project/            # A folder where your organized code lives
│       ├── __init__.py       # A marker file that indicates this folder is for Python code
│       ├── module            # A file or folder with specific functions or classes
│       └── extras/           # A folder for additional, related code

├── requirements.txt          # Software dependencies (environment.yml if using Conda)

:::

These structures are a starting point and can be adapted based on the specific needs and practices of your project. Some additional tips:

- Particular metadata files are often capitalized, such as README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CHANGELOG, CITATION.cff, NOTICE, and MANIFEST.
- Generally, all content that is generated upon building or running your code should be added to `.gitignore`. This likely includes the content of `processed_data` and `results` folder. 
- Git cannot track empty folders. If you want to add empty folders to enforce a folder structure, e.g., `processed_data` or`results`, the convention is to add the file `.gitkeep` to the folder.

## {{< fa warning >}} **Managing data**
If your raw data files or any data assets are large (typically more than a few megabytes), it’s usually best not to include them directly in the repository. Instead:

- Keep such files externally (e.g. cloud storage, Git LFS), and add only a reference or a small sample to the repository.
- Adding placeholder files or instructions in the README for how to obtain the complete datasets.
