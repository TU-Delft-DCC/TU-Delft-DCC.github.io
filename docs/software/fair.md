The goal of the FAIR principles is to improve research transparency, reproducibility and reusability. To achieve this, your research needs to be described through metadata, should be open for inspection, well-documented, and well structured. This ensures that it can be replicated, expanded upon, merged, reinterpreted, or reimplemented. The acronym FAIR stands for:

- **F**indable: Your research software can be easily found (i.e. has rich metadata, unique identifiers).
- **A**ccessible: Once found, it can be accessed, ideally through well-defined and open protocols.
- **I**nteroperable: Your research is compatible with other datasets, tools, and workflows, allowing for integration and reuse across various applications and fields.
- **R**eusable: The ultimate goal is that your research outputs can be reused in different contexts. This requires comprehensive documentation, clear licensing, and a modular structure.

While originally targetting data management, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) extends these principles to research software, which, unlike data, is executable and evolves over time. Ensuring the findability of software involves metadata, identifiers, and version control systems, while accessibility includes guidelines for obtaining, installing, and running the software. Interoperability involves adherence to community-driven standards or protocols, and reusability requires detailed documentation and user guides to effectively apply the software in new research projects.
