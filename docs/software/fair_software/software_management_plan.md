A software management plan (SMP) helps to implement best practices during software development and ensures that software is accessible and reusable in the short and longer term. The Netherlands eScience Center and NWO, the Dutch Research Council, have taken the initiative to develop (national) guidelines for software management plans, which resulted in the publication of the [**Practical guide to Software Management Plans**](https://zenodo.org/record/7248877) in October 2022.

As an introduction to Software Management Plans, TU Delft has created a video:

The [Intermediate Research Software Development](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) course from The Carpentries is a good resource to learn the core principle of intermediate-level software development and best practices collaborating in a team.

 ### Software Architecture diagrams

C4 model is a popular approach to draw good software architecture diagram that software development teams use to communicate efficiently. It is easy to learn and adopt into existing projects as well as design new projects from scratch. It provides a set of hierarchical abstractions and diagrams to visualize software architecture in a notation independent manner. 

While a marker and a whiteboard is more than enough to get started with the C4 model, the [C4-PlantUML library](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) provides an easy-to-understand language to create C4 diagrams with PlantUML. The library is handy with macros, snippets and a VSCode extension.
