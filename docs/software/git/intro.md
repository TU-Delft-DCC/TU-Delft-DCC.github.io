Using a version control system provides better management to your code. It allows tracing back changes made, facilitates collaboration and dissemination of the code files. As using a version control system is becoming standard, some scientific journals (e.g. Science and Nature) require code used for modelling or data analysis to be available in a publicly accessible repository. Git is the most popular and commonly used version control software.   

Following are the different ways in which you can learn version control with Git: 

- [Sign up](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/software-carpentry-workshops) for the software carpentry workshop (free of cost) at TU Delft.  

- Learn at your own pace using the publicly available training material from the [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and [Code Refinery](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/)

- Use the [Repository Template](https://github.com/manuGil/fair-code) to make your code more compliant with FAIR principles
