Packaging allows developers to bundle their code into a format that is easily installable and manageable across different environments. By creating a package/library, you ensure that all necessary components, including dependencies and configuration files, are included in a single unit, simplifying the installation process for users. Here you can find how to package your Python or R projects for distribution.
