Code smells are software characteristics that suggest there might be an issue with the code's design or implementation. While code smells themselves might not always indicate a bug or malfunction, they can make the code harder to understand and extend, which can lead to bugs and other issues down the line. Code smells are usually noticed and addressed during code reviews, when writing tests, adding new features, fixing bugs, and during automated code analysis.

## {{< fa lightbulb >}} How to use these cards?
Each guide provides an overview of a code smell, its symptoms and an example on [how to refactor it](./refactoring.md). We don't intend to cover all refactoring techniques, but we aim to provide a starting point for identifying and addressing common code smells.

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Long Method
**Problem:** A function is very long and hard to understand.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor long methods](./code_smells/long_method.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Large Classes
**Problem:** A class contains too many responsibilities or functionalities.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor large classes](./code_smells/large_class.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Code Duplication
**Problem:** The same or very similar code appears in multiple places.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor duplicate code](./code_smells/duplication.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Hard-Coded Values
**Problem:** Literal values (e.g., numeric values or strings) are directly embedded in the code.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor hard-coded values](./code_smells/hardcoded_values.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Deep Nesting
**Problem:** There are excessive levels of nested for-loops or if-statements.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor nested logic](./code_smells/deep_nesting.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Many Inputs
**Problem:** Functions require a long list of parameters.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor argument lists](./code_smells/many_arguments.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Inappropriate Intimacy
**Problem:** Two classes or methods depend too much on each other's internals.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor coupling](./code_smells/inappropriate_intimacy.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Side Effects
**Problem:** Changes in one part of the code cause unexpected behavior in another.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor side effects](./code_smells/side_effects.md)
:::
:::
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
::: {.code-smell-card}
##### Commented out Code
**Problem:** There is a significant amount of outdated or commented-out code.  

::: {.refactor-link}
[{{< fa wrench >}} Refactor commented code](./code_smells/dead_code.md)
