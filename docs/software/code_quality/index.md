>"Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?"

The quality of your research software plays a crucial role in its reliability, maintainability, and scalability. Writing **clean code** means developing code that is easy to read, understand - not for just you, but for others as well. **Well-structured code** simplifies debugging  and allows for future modifications and extensions, ensuring your software remains useful and adaptable over time.
