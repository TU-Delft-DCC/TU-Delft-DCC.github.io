### Sonar
[Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) is a cloud-based service that provides inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static code analysis to detect bugs, code smells and security vulnerabilities in a project. It supports many programming languages and integrates with GitHub (and GitLab and Bitbucket) as part of the Continuous Integration workflows. Sonar is particularly useful for projects that require compliance with coding standards or need regular feedback on the quality of the code.

## Consideration
While Sonar offers valuable features for code quality analysis, be aware that for **non open-source projects it is a paid service**, and pricing model depends on how many lines of code you want to check.

### GitHub CodeQL
GitHub CodeQL is a semantic code analysis engine that allows you to write queries to find security vulnerabilities in your codebase. It is particularly useful for identifying security vulnerabilities in open-source projects, and it can be integrated into your GitHub Actions workflow to automatically scan your code for vulnerabilities. CodeQL is available for a variety of programming languages, and it can help you identify and fix security issues before they become a problem.

### Code coverage
Code coverage quantifies the proportion of source code that is run by a software programâ€™s (unit) test suite. It helps to identify which parts of the codebase have been tested, and achieving a high code coverage generally indicates a lower likelihood of hidden bugs. However, it is important to note that high code coverage does not necessarily translate to high code quality - it simply tells us how much of the codebase is being tested.

### Dependabot
Dependabot is a GitHub app that helps you keep your dependencies up to date. It checks for outdated dependencies in your project and automatically creates pull requests to update them. This can help you stay on top of security vulnerabilities and ensure that your project is using the latest features and bug fixes.

### OpenSSF
The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices badge provides a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to demonstrate their adherence to best practices. Projects can choose to self-certify for free. Inspired by the numerous badges available on GitHub, the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge allows to quickly identify which FLOSS projects are committed to best practices and are therefore more likely to deliver high-quality and secure software.

The criteria for earning the passing badge and additional details about the OpenSSF Best Practices Badging program can be found on GitHub.
