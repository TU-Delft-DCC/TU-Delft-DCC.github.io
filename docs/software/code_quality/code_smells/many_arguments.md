### Long parameter list {.unnumbered}
A function or method accepts parameters that are not necessary for its operation, leading to increased coupling and decreased readability. It can make the code harder to understand and maintain, as well as increase the risk of errors due to the misuse of parameters. Refactoring to reduce the number of parameters and passing only the necessary data can help improve code clarity and maintainability.

## Example of long parameter list

```python
def process_kite_flight(kite_name: str, wind_speed: float, kite_angle: float, power_generated: float):
    # Process kite flight data
    print("Kite Name:", kite_name)
    print("Wind Speed:", wind_speed)
    print("Kite Angle:", kite_angle)
    print("Power Generated:", power_generated)
    # Additional processing logic...

# Usage
process_kite_flight(kite_name = "Kite_1", wind_speed=20.5, kite_angle=45.0, power_generated=150.0)
```

## Solution

- If a function requires a large number of parameters, it may be a sign that it's doing too much. Break down the function into smaller, more focused functions or classes with clearer responsibilities.
- Instead of passing a long list of parameters, encapsulate related data into meaningful objects or data structures. By passing objects or data structures, you can reduce the number of parameters while still providing necessary information to the function.

## Example solution with dataclasses

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Create a dataclass to encapsulate kite flight data which can be 
# passed as a single parameter 
@dataclass
class KiteFlightData:
    name: str
    wind_speed: float
    kite_angle: float
    power_generated: float

def process_kite_flight(kite_data: KiteFlightData):
    # Process kite flight data
    print("Kite Name:", kite_data.name)
    print("Wind Speed:", kite_data.wind_speed)
    print("Kite Angle:", kite_data.kite_angle)
    print("Power Generated:", kite_data.power_generated)
    # Additional processing logic...

# Usage 
flight_data = KiteFlightData(name="Kite_1", wind_speed=20.5, kite_angle=45.0, power_generated=150.0)
process_kite_flight(flight_data)
```

You can combine dataclasses with data validation through [**Pydantic**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).

:::{.callout-caution}
## Divide and conquer

Be careful not to create too large datastructures as this increases complexity and may introduce tight coupling. Instead, break down large datastructures into smaller, more manageable pieces based on logical grouping or functionality. Use composition to combine smaller data classes into larger ones where necessary.
