### Dead and commented code {.unnumbered}
Dead and commented code refers to parts of the code that are no longer in use or have been superseded but are not deleted, only commented out. Such code can clutter the codebase, making it hard to read and maintain.

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Solution

Remove it. Commit the removal of the commented-out code with a meaningful commit message explaining why it was removed. This allows you to track the change and easily revert it if necessary.
