A "long method" is a common code where a method or function becomes overly long and handles multiple responsibilities at once. This makes the code hard to read, understand, test, and maintain. Long methods often indicate that a function is doing too much and may benefit from being broken into smaller, more focussed helper functions.

## Symptoms
A long method often:

- Performs multiple tasks rather than a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Has deeply nested control structures, making it harder to follow.
- Includes multiple sections of logic that could be extracted into separate functions.

## Example - Long method
Below is an example of a function that is doing too much:

```python
def load_data(filepath: str):
    # Check if data file exists
    if not os.path.exists(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError("File not found")
    
    _, extension = os.path.splitext(filepath)

    # Load data based on file extension    
    if extension == ".json":
        with open(filepath, "r") as file:
            # If file extension is .json: load json data
            data = json.load(file)
    elif extension == ".pickle":
        with open(filepath, "rb") as file:
            # If file extionsion is .pickle: load pickled data
            data = pickle.load(file)
    elif extension == ".csv":
        # If file extionsion is .csv: load cvs data
        data = read_csv(filepath)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported file format: {extension}")
    
    # Verify content of data set
    if not isinstance(data, (list, dict, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise ValueError("Invalid data format")

    return data
```


#### Issues
- The function is handling file validation, data loading, and data verification, which are separate concerns.
- It is now difficult to test individual parts in isolation.
- Adding support for new file types requires modifying a large function.


### Solution
Identify logical blocks of code within the long method/function and extract them into separate methods with descriptive names. We should aim to make each method responsible for a singular task and compose more complex functionalities from modular components.

#### Example solution long method


```python
def load_data(filepath: str) -> Data:
    verify_filepath(filepath: str)  
    data = read_data(filepath: str)
    verify_data(data)
    return data

# Helper function to verify file path
def verify_filepath(filepath: str):
    if not os.path.exists(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError("File not found")

# Helper function to read data from file based on its extension
def read_data(filepath: str) -> Data:
    # Extract file extension
    _, extension = os.path.splitext(filepath)
    
    # Create dictionary mapping file extensions to read functions
    data_types = {
        ".json": read_from_json,
        ".pickle": read_from_pickle,
        ".csv": read_from_csv,
    }

    # Select read function based on file extension
    try:
        read_function = data_types[extension]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported file format: {extension}")
    return data_types[extension](filepath)

# Placeholder for helper functions to read data from different file formats
def read_from_json(filepath: str): pass
def read_from_pickle(filepath: str): pass
def read_from_csv(filepath: str): pass
```

## Key takeaways
- Breaking a long method into smaller, well-named helper functions makes the code easier to read and understand.
– Each function now has a single responsibility, reducing complexity and making future modifications more manageable.
– With isolated functions, individual components can be tested independently, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

{{< fa thumbs-up >}} By breaking the long method into smaller helper functions, we improve the overall structure and maintainability of the code.
