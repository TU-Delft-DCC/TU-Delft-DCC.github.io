Duplicated code occurs when similar or identical blocks of code appear multiple times within a codebase. This can increase maintenance efforts, as changes in one place might require corresponding changes elsewhere, leading to inconsistencies and higher changes or errors. 

## Symptoms
- The same logic appears in multiple places, sometimes with minor variations.
- Fixing a bug required modifying the same code in multiple places.
- Adding a new feature results in copy-pasting existing code rather than reusing it.

## Example - Duplicate code in functions
```python
def time_of_flight_ball(initial_velocity, launch_angle):
    g = 9.81  # Earth's gravity (m/s²)
    return (2 * initial_velocity * np.sin(launch_angle)) / g

def time_of_flight_rocket(initial_velocity, launch_angle):
    g = 9.81
    return (2 * initial_velocity * np.sin(launch_angle)) / g

def time_of_flight_satellite(initial_velocity, launch_angle):
    g = 9.81
    return (2 * initial_velocity * np.sin(launch_angle)) / g

```

### Solution 
- Refactor the code to accept parameters as arguments, instead of hard-coding them.
- Extract common functionality into functions or methods.
- Refactor duplicated code into higher-level abstractions.
- Make use of utility functions to centralize common code and avoid duplication.

```python	
def time_of_flight(initial_velocity, launch_angle, gravity=9.81):
    """Compute time of flight for any projectile."""
    return (2 * initial_velocity * np.sin(launch_angle)) / gravity

# Usage
tof_ball = time_of_flight(30, np.pi/4)       # Time of flight for a ball
tof_rocket = time_of_flight(100, np.pi/3)    # Time of flight for a rocket
tof_mars_probe = time_of_flight(300, np.pi/6, gravity=3.71)  # Gravity adjusted for Mars
```	

## Key takeaways
- Extracting common functionality into functions or methods can help reduce duplication and improve code reuse.
