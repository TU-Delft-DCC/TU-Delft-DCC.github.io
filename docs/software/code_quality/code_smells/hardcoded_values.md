Hard-coding variables occurs when constants and specific values are directly embedded into the code instead of being defined as variables or passed as arguments. Hard-coding makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain because changing the behavior requires modifying the source code rather than adjusting parameters. 

This smell is often noticed when changing the program's behavior required direct source code modification, rather than simple configuration changes or parameter adjustments.


## Symptoms
- You find yourself searching the codebase for specific values to tweak behavior for different executions.
- The same constant value appears multiple times, making updates error-prone.
- The logic is less readable, since magic numbers donâ€™t indicate what they represent.
- Code cannot easily adapt to different contexts without modification.

## Example of hard coding and magic numbers
```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    # Hard-coded value of pi
    return 3.14 * radius * radius # What if you need more precision?

def check_temperature(temperature):
    # Hard-coded temperature values for thresholding
    if temperature > 30: # What does 30 represent
        print("It's too hot!")
    elif temperature < 10:
        print("It's too cold!")
```

### Issues
- The value of pi is hard-coded as `3.14`, which can lead to precision issues.
- The temperature thresholds (30, 10) are buried in the logic, making them difficult to modify.
- The meaning of 30 and 10 is unclear - are they for a specific region, season, or use case?


## Solution
Using named constants and configurable parameters makes the code more readable, maintainable, and flexible.

## Example solution with default parameters
```python
import numpy as np  # Use a library constant

HOT_THRESHOLD = 30  # Defined constant for readability
COLD_THRESHOLD = 10  # Defined constant for readability

def calculate_area(radius):  # Default parameter allows customization
    return np.pi * radius * radius # Use library constant for pi

def check_temperature(temperature, hot_threshold=HOT_THRESHOLD, cold_threshold=COLD_THRESHOLD):
    if temperature > hot_threshold: # Use named constants for readability
        print("It's too hot!")
    elif temperature < cold_threshold:
        print("It's too cold!")

```
