### What is refactoring?

Refactoring is the process of **restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior**. It improves maintainability and readability, making future developments smoother and reducing the likelihood of bugs. Key benefits include:

- **Improving readability** - Writing code that's easier to understand, benefits both yourself and future developers.
- **Reducing complexity** - Simplifying complex structures by breaking down large functions or removing unnecessary dependencies.
- **Optimizing design** - Creating a more robust and adaptable codebase for long-term growth. 
- **Eliminating redundancies** - Removing duplicate or unnecessary code.
- **Ensuring consistency** - Following a consistent coding style for a cleaner, more maintanable codebase.

### When should you refactor?
![CC-BY-4.0 Â© 2021 Balaban et al.](/docs/img/refactoring.PNG){width=50%}

1. **Rule of three:** If you find yourself writing the same or similiar code for the third time, it's time to refactor.
2. **Before adding a feature:** Cleaning up existing code makes it easier to integrate a new functionality.
3. **When fixing a bug:** Cleaning up surrounding code can help uncover and fix the issue faster.
4. **During code reviews:** Refactoring during code reviews can prevent issues from becoming part of the public codebase and streamline the development process.
5. **When you spot a code smell:** Addressing [code smells](./code_smells.md) early prevents them from evolving into more serious bugs.

### How to refactor code effectively?

Refactoring should be done gradually, improving code in small controlled 
steps without introducing new functionalities. Keep these principles in mind:

{{< fa broom >}} **Maintain clean code** - Aim for clarity, simplicity, and readability.  
{{< fa ban >}} **Avoid adding new features** - Focus on improving structure, not functionality.  
{{< fa check-double >}} **Ensure tests pass** - Verify that all existing tests still succeed to prevent new bugs.
