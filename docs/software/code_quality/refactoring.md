Refactoring is the process of **restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior**. Refactoring helps make the code more maintainable and understandable, which in turn makes it easier to build on and less likely to develop bugs. This can include:

- Improving readability - making code easier to understand, which helps future maintainers and external partners.
- Reducing complexity - simplifying complex code structures, which can involve breaking down large functions into smaller, more manageable pieces or removing unnecessary dependencies.
- Optimizing software design - making it more robust and adaptable for future needs. 
- Identifying and eliminating redundancies - removing duplicated or unnecessary code.
- Ensuring consistency - adhere to a consistent coding style accross the codebase to ensure the code is uniform.


### Refactoring workflow

#### When to refactor code?

1. **Rule of three:** Begin refactoring when the same or very similar code is being written for the third time.
2. **When adding a feature:** Refactoring existing code before adding new features can help simplify the integration of new functionality.
3. **When fixing a bug:** Cleaning up code in the areas around a bug can make it easier to identify and fix the issue.
4. **During a code review:** Refactoring during code reviews can prevent issues from becoming part of the public codebase and streamline the development process.
5. **Finding a code smell** (see below)

#### How to refactor code?

Refactoring should be done through minor changes without breaking the underlying code. Each iteration should make your code slightly better, and could be done according to this checklist:

1. **Maintain clean code:** Refactor with the aim to make the code cleaner and more efficient.
2. **Avoid adding new features:** Refactor without introducing new functionalities.
3. **Keep tests passing:** All existing tests should still be passing after refactoring, ensuring no new bugs are introduced.
