To connect to a remote host, TU Delft uses a *proxy server*, know as  **bastion**. To reach a remote host, a user has to connect first to the **bastion** and from there to the remote host. However, a user can connect directly to the remote host using *ssh tunneling*.

## Set a Default SSH Tunneling for a Host (Linux Terminal)

1. On your local machine, edit the `~/.ssh/config` file and add the following confuration:

```bash 
Host <host-nickname>
    HostName <target-host>
    User <target-username>
    ProxyCommand ssh <bastion-username>@linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl -W %h:%p 
```
Replace:
**<host-nickname>:** a name for you choice for the targe host, e.g., `my-server`
**<target-host>:** the actual name of the target host (FQDM), e.g, `server.tudelft.nl`
**<target-username>:**  the username used to login to the target host
**<bastion-username>:** the username used to login to the bastion server

1. Create a key-pair on the local machine.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/<my-keyname> -t rsa -b 4096
```
You will be promted to crate a *passphrase*, we recommend you to add one to make the connection more secure. The passphrase will be asked every time you connect to the target host.

A private and public keys will be added to `~/.ssh`. The public key is in the `<my-keyname>.pub`

3. Copy the content of the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file in the target host.

4. Connect to the target host using *ssh tunneling*. Use your *bastion-password* when asked.

```bash
$ ssh <host-nickname>
```

If you encounter problems with the connection. Use the debug mode `ssh -vvv <host-nickname>` to find out what might have gone wrong.


## Tunneling with WinSCP

WinSCP is a GUI that makes it very easy to inspect, edit and transfer files on the webserver. Instructions for setting this up on a hypothetical server from the CiTG faculty are provided below. General documentation on tunneling with WinSCP are here: https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_tunnel

_These instructions were tested with an existing `id_ed25519` key, assume you already have WinSCP installed and can modify a text file on the server in your user directory using the terminal._

Do the following:

1. As explained above, log in to the server and add your public key to the file `/home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys` (this only needs to be done once).

It should look like this with your own keys `XXXXXXX` and NetID filled between the `<...>` (note the `<XXXXXXX>` is much longer in reality):

```bash
ssh-rsa <XXXXXXX> ICT-SYSTEMS-<NETID>
ssh-rsa <XXXXXXX> ICT-SYSTEMS-<NETID>
ssh-ed25519 <XXXXXXX> <NETID>@tudelft.nl
```

2. Using WinSCP, the following fields should be entered:

On the main login settings page:
- File protocol: `SFTP`
- Host name: `<server>.citg.tudelft.nl`
- User name: your NetID

3. Open the "Advanced..." window

4. On the page "Tunnel" (under heading "Connection," still in the Advanced window):
- Host name: `linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl`
- User name: your NetID

5. On the page "Authentication" (under heading "SSH," still in the Advanced window):
- Private key file: select your private key file, for example `C:..../<username>/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- Note that the app may ask you to convert your existing key to a Putty format (for example "Do you want to convert OpenSSH private key to PuTTY format?"). Click "OK" then make sure you select the new PuTTY file (e.g., `C:..../<username>/.ssh/id_ed25519.ppk`)

6. Save the setting and click "Login", using your NetID password to authenticate.

### Using WinSCP with sudo rights

If you have sudo rights on the webserver you can use this via WinSCP as follows:

1. Once agin go to the "Advanced..." window to the "SFTP" page under heading "Environment"
2. In field "SFTP server" enter the following: `sudo /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server`
3. Save the changes
4. Use with caution!

Note that the path to `sftp-server` may be different but can be easily checked and arranged. This will not work if you change the setting and continue to use an open session.
