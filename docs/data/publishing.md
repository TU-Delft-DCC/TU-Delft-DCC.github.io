# Prepare data for publishing  

If you would like to publish your data collection in 4TU.ResearchData or another data repository, it is advisable that you discuss the publishing process, including the reuse and [citation](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/publish/cite-your-data) of the original datasets and appropriate [licensing](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/use/publish-cite/upload-your-data-in-our-data-repository/licencing) options with your faculty [Data Steward](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/support/data-stewardship/contact). 

- To learn more about research data management, you can participate in an introductory workshop on [Research Data Management](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101) offered by TU Delft, or review materials from online resources. 

- [Managing and Sharing Research Data](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/managing-and-sharing-research-data/) course from [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) - e-learning platform that brings together the training resources addressed to those who need to develop strategies and skills for implementing Open Science practices in their daily workflows 

- See a videos on [best practices](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/organising/) on organising data files from [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) 

- See a [General guide](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/How+to+Prepare+Data+for+PublicationA+An+Overview/1_v0who3u4) prepared by [Princeton Research Data Service](https://researchdata.princeton.edu/) on how to prepare data for publication as well more detailed videos on:  
    - [READMEs and codebooks ](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Preparing+Data+for+PublicationA+Readmes+and+Documentation/1_sknb0yn3)
    - [Findability and accessibility](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Preparing+Data+for+PublicationA+Discovery+and+Reuse/1_gicf5vb0)
    - [Citing data](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Preparing+Data+for+PublicationA+Citing+Data/1_3kvorg8j)

To prepare the data, see [TU Delft Library recommendations](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/manage/collect-and-document) regarding data documentation:  

- Make sure to include metadata document in the data package. Follow 4TU.ResearchData guide on writing [README](https://data.4tu.nl/info//fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/Guidelines_for_creating_a_README_file.pdf) file. 

- For tabular data, consider creating a [code book](https://ddialliance.org/training/getting-started-new-content/create-a-codebook).  

- Determine whether there is a defined/ preferred metadata standard for your discipline and follow the standard. You can browse through existing standards [here](https://fairsharing.org/).  

- Consider the file format of the data. Data repositories might have preferred file formats, that ensure interoperability  and long-term preservation of the files. See the list of [4TU.ResearchData preferred file formats](https://data.4tu.nl/info/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/Preferred_File_Formats_2019.pdf) or [UK Data Archive recommended and acceptable file formats](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats/). The list might vary by repository, so it is important to cross-reference your file formats with the list of recommended formats of the repository of your choice.
