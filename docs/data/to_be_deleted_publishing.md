- To learn more about research data management, you can participate in an introductory workshop on [Research Data Management](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101) offered by TU Delft, or review materials from online resources.
- See a videos on [best practices](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/organising/) on organising data files from [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/).
- See a [General guide](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/How+to+Prepare+Data+for+PublicationA+An+Overview/1_v0who3u4) prepared by [Princeton Research Data Service](https://researchdata.princeton.edu/) on how to prepare data for publication as well more detailed videos on:
    - [READMEs and codebooks ](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Preparing+Data+for+PublicationA+Readmes+and+Documentation/1_sknb0yn3)
    - [Findability and accessibility](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Preparing+Data+for+PublicationA+Discovery+and+Reuse/1_gicf5vb0)
    - [Citing data](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Preparing+Data+for+PublicationA+Citing+Data/1_3kvorg8j)

To prepare the data, see [TU Delft Library recommendations](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/manage/collect-and-document) regarding data documentation:

- Make sure to include metadata document in the data package. Follow 4TU.ResearchData guide on writing [README](https://data.4tu.nl/s/documents/Guidelines_for_creating_a_README_file.pdf) file.
- For tabular data, consider creating a codebook.
- Determine whether there is a defined/ preferred metadata standard for your discipline and follow the standard. You can browse through existing standards [here](https://fairsharing.org/).  
- Consider the file format of the data. Data repositories might have preferred file formats, that ensure interoperability  and long-term preservation of the files. See the list of [4TU.ResearchData preferred file formats](https://data.4tu.nl/s/documents/Preferred_File_Formats_2019.pdf) or [UK Data Archive recommended and acceptable file formats](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats/). The list might vary by repository, so it is important to cross-reference your file formats with the list of recommended formats of the repository of your choice.
