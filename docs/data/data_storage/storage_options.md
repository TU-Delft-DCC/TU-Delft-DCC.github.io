Storing your data in a secure location is a key element of a successful project with a data component. TU Delft recommends using a [Project Drive](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=846ebb16181c43b5836c063a917dd199&from=03aa10b9-c5aa-4e0a-80b1-28ee7ab383df) for storing research data. This solution enables secure data storage with controlled access for collaborators during the project lifecycle, while ensuring continued availability to TU Delft researchers after project completion. 

TU Delft offers various data storage options and solutions with varying access protocols. You can explore available options through the [Service Portal (TU Delft authentication required)](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=f359caaa60264f99b0084941736786ae&from=feffb489-e1f9-49cd-8223-53ae0b70b609).
