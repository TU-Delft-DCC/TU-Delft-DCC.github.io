Storing your data in a secure location is a key element of a successful project with a data component. As a TU Delft researcher, you have several options. Below you can find an overview of the available storage options, depending on whether they are local, networked, or cloud-based, how secure they are, whether they can be shared with internal or external partners, and whether they are automatically backed up or not. Please visit the sections on [Data Security](../data_storage/security.md), [Data Sharing](../data_storage/sharing.md) and [Data Backup](../data_storage/backup.md) for more information on these topics.

## *Project Drive* operations

A *Project Drive* is a TU Delft managed network drive that allows you to store and share data with your project team members. It is a secure and reliable option for storing research data, and it is automatically backed up. 

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## {{< fa lightbulb >}} **For most situations, the *Project Data Storage (U:)* drive is the optimal choice for storing research data.**

Below you can see how to access a *Project Data Storage (U:)* drive, request space for it, and how to mount it on a server (please refer to the section on [Remote Servers](../../infrastructure/remote_servers.md) for more details).
