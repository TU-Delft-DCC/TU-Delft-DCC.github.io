In the context of research data management, "Data Storage" refers to securely housing research data on various digital media or infrastructure, having it readily accessible for *ongoing work*, analysis, and collaboration throughout the *active* phase of a research project. It involves the systems and practices used to maintain the availability, integrity, and accessibility of data while it is actively being used, processed, or shared by the research team. This includes both *local* and *networked* solutions, serving as the persistent layer for active research operations involving collaborators *internal* to TU Delft, or *external*.

Data storage, rather than being confined to a single step, functions as a persistent foundation, supporting activities from initial data acquisition through active analysis. As a researcher, you may frequently move between phases, such as returning to data collection after initial analysis reveals gaps, or refining processing methods based on analytical outcomes. This interconnected and iterative nature is crucial for effective research data management, as it means that planning for later stages, like archiving and publishing, must occur early, and ongoing management activities, such as storage and security, are not isolated tasks but integral to every step of active research. 

This section details the recommended storage solutions available to TU Delft researchers, emphasizing institutional and national (Dutch/European) services and providing guidance on their appropriate use. It also highlights the importance of data security, sharing, and backup as essential components of effective data storage practices.
