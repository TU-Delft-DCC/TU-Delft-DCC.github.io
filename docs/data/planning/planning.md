Planning for managing your data throughout its lifecycle (collection, storage, sharing, publication, and archiving) is, more than recommended, a requirement that TU Delft and [research funders](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/policies/funders-policies) expect nowadays from researchers when referring to their research. By default, this requirement is fulfilled by the writing of a **data management plan (DMP)**.

**Do you need to write a DMP?** TU Delft Library helps you with that step via [DMPonline](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/plan/dmponline/dmponline). For advice and assistance on writing your DMP, contact your [faculty Data Steward](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/support/data-stewardship/contact).

Through the writing of your DMP you will have to reflect upon/take into account ethics, privacy and security concerns that your data may arise. We expand on these concerns in two separate subsections that you can find bellow.
