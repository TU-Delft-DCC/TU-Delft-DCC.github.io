When planning your research, it is important to consider how you will manage your data. This is the very first step in the research data lifecycle; you define your research question, and pinpoint relevant data sources. This includes planning how you will collect, store, and share your data, as well as how you will ensure its security and privacy. You formulate a plan for your data management, which is a living document that you can update as your research progresses.

## Data management plan

TU Delft emphasizes the importance of data management planning and asks researchers to create a data management plan (DMP) at the start of their research project. In many cases this is also a formal [requirement](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/policies/funders-policies). TU Delft provides a dedicated tool called [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) to help you write a DMP.

**Please consult your faculty [data steward](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/support/data-stewardship/contact) for more information regarding DMPs and the specific requirements for your faculty.**
