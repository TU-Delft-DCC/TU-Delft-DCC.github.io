This section provides resources to support data owners and users at various stages of the data lifecycle. It highlights important information and available tooling at TU Delft that can help you implement the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) principles in your research data management practices.

TU Delft emphasizes researchersâ€™ adherence to best practices in Research Data and Software Management (RDSM) as crucial to research quality. The university has maintained policies for a structured framework clarifying roles, responsibilities, and procedural standards for RDSM.

Research data includes any information observed, generated or created for use in research projects. Though often tied to specific research projects, research data follows its own lifecycle, which is distinct from the project itself. After initial data collection, data may be processed, analyzed, published, shared, archived, reused or destroyed.

Effective research data management by following FAIR principles ensures efficiency and reproducibility at every step of the data lifecycle. At TU Delft, various tools and resources are available to meet diverse data management needs at any stage in its lifecycle.
