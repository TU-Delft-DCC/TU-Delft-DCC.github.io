Data collection is one of the first steps in the data lifecycle. It involves gathering and recording data from various sources, which can include (but are not limited to) experiments, observations, simulations or existing datasets. These can come from various sources being both public and private. The data collected can be quantitative or qualitative, and it can be structured or unstructured. The choice of data collection methods and tools depends on the research objectives, the type of data needed, and the resources available. 

Proper data collection practices are essential for ensuring the integrity and reliability of the data, as well as for its use later analysis and interpretation. This section provides an overview of important aspects of data collection, including data conventions, data access and reuse, and the use of eLabJournal and RSpace. These elements are essential for maintaining the quality and usability of research data, and they play a significant role in the overall research process.
