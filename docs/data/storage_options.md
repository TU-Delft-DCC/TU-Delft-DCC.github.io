Storing your data in a secure location is a key element of a successful project with a data component. TU Delft recommends using a [Project Drive](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=846ebb16181c43b5836c063a917dd199&from=03aa10b9-c5aa-4e0a-80b1-28ee7ab383df) for storing research data. This solution enables secure data storage and facilitates access to your data to other researchers from your research group during the duration of the project. It also allows TU Delft researchers to have access to the data after your PhD contract is completed. 

The TU Delft offers various data storage options. A complete list is available throught the [Service desk](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=f359caaa60264f99b0084941736786ae&from=feffb489-e1f9-49cd-8223-53ae0b70b609) (TU delft login required).
